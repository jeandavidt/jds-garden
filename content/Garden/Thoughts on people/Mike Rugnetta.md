[Mike Rugnetta](https://rugnetta.com) was my favourite internet person for a full decade, between 2012 and 2022 when he stopped being publicly active. He was the brains behind [PBS Idea Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2bAN9pPeiE&list=PLtHP6qx8VF7eIWKSZIbqzvK_2j2H1KpD8) , a quirky, very 2012-y show about the internet, pop culture, art, philosophy, and the intersections between them all.

Mike is the one who turned me on to the idea that internet culture was *interesting* and was worth thinking about deeply. He pointed me towards so many interesting ideas --- [[Susan Sontag]]'s [essays on photography ](https://writing.upenn.edu/library/Sontag-Susan-Photography.pdf), [Jean Beaudrillard]()'s [hyperreal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7Z_28Uk6g), and the [unreasonable effectiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNymweHW4E) of [mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf)

The tone of Idea Channel is phrenetic and very jumpcut-y, but it's still very much worth a watch and a good think!

**Update** 2025-01-27: He's back!
