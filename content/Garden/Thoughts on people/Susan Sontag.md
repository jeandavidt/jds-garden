An American essayist I deeply respect. She wrote about [photography](https://writing.upenn.edu/library/Sontag-Susan-Photography.pdf), empathy, and the [limited ability of media to represent suffering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52373.Regarding_the_Pain_of_Others),

## Quotes

> To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge-and, therefore, like power.


> Someone who is permanently surprised that depravity exists, who continues to feel disillusioned (even incredulous) when confronted with evidence of what humans are capable of inflicting in the way of gruesome, hands-on cruelties upon other humans, has not reached moral or psychological adulthood.


> People don't become inured to what they are shown - if that's the right way to describe what happens - because of the quantity of images dumped on them. It is passivity that dulls feeling. The states described as apathy, moral or emotional anaesthesia, are full of feelings; the feelings are rage and frustration.
