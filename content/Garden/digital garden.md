This site is where I am building my [digital garden](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html)

Why keep a digital garden?

- Because writing imposes a slower pace than constantly consuming content. It invites reflection, digestion, and the emergence of new ideas.
- Because writing is a form of thinking. Not only that, it is a way to transmit thoughts between people across time and space. As such, [writing is a form of telepathy](https://alearningaday.blog/2019/06/02/writing-is-telepathy/), which I find pretty cool in and of itself.
- Because I don't know much of anything. But by putting down traces of my current understanding somewhere, I build a foundation I can revisit and improve upon, editing and expanding it, instead of having to rely on my memory and the vague impressions that stay with me after consuming a piece of content.
- Because we are all learning. By writing about things *as I learn them* instead of delaying to an indefinite future where I know \*enough\* $^{\text({TM})}$, maybe I can produce bits and pieces of information that can useful to others.
- Because I believe in the power of networks to develop emergent structures, organize complexity, and create new meaning.
- Because the idea of getting lost in a [meandering path of hypertext](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) is really cool to me. I would love to be able to experience the familiar in ways that feel a little strange.
- Because it feels good to build a space that is truly your own, where you can experiment with web technologies, design and writing --- social media timelines and research reports are nice and all, but they can only do so much.
