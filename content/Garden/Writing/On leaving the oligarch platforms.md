## From a web to private estates
In recent years, the internet has shifted from a decentralized network where users manage their own sites and blogs with their unique mix of content, questionable design and animated gifs (thinking of you, [geocities](https://geocities.restorativland.org/Hollywood/) and [skyblog](https://www.instagram.com/skyblog_museum/?hl=en)) and started agglomerating behind centralized platforms.

These platforms pitched themselves to their users a simple way to create a home on the internet and [share their lives with friends](https://youtu.be/ZDuyyH60FOg?si=AJcNS1bg9UpmAnxW) . In exchange, they interposed themselves between users and each other's content with algorithmic feeds and sponsored content. They leveraged their middleman position to influence what people could see, and they got to set the price of entry for people and businesses looking for an audience.

## Clawing at our eyeballs for profit
The [attention economy](https://pressbooks.usnh.edu/com743/chapter/the-attention-economy-algorithmic-search/#:~:text=Personalized%20–%20In%20the%20study%20of,Transparency%20Act%20resource%20listed%20below.) was born, and with it, our collective ability to *choose* what to pay attention to massively declined because at any point in time, people are now having to compete with every platform's best effort to serve you the [stickiest content it can muster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfczi2cI6Cs). Sure, they want to keep you on the platform and sell you things, but they also [influence your mood by manipulating your feed](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1320040111),  [promoting inflamatory content that increase engagement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFFBfw_mz6I),  [helping the spread of misinformation](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/how-social-media-rewards-misinformation), and [actively suppressing topics that are seen as inconvenient or  disruptive](https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and).

## Kissing the ring
In the last few days:
- Virtually every billionaire tech CEO in the United States [attended Trump's inauguration](https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd),
- Zuckerberg, days before the inauguration, [announced the end of fact-checking on Facebook] in the United States.
- Hours before the inauguration, TikTok shut down in the US for a few hours when the TikTok ban went into effect. When it came bak, [the app sported a pop-up notification thanking Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tiktok-restoring-service/story?id=117857636) (who wasn't yet president at the time) for the allowing the app to come back. US users also found that searches with political keywords were [no longer turning out results](https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/2025/01/22/tiktok-users-report-anti-trump-content-being-hidden-following-platforms-unbanning/), suggesting that the deal that brought TikTok back may very well have come with political strings attached.
- Musk, who owns X, is now at the head of DOGE, a new department of the US Government's executive branch. He has[ openly supported far-right political actors](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/20/elon-musk-backs-germanys-far-right-afd-before-elections) and, on the day of the inauguration, [straight up used the Nazi salute–twice](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute) while on stage. His platform has also been widely criticized for [allowing hate speech to spread unimpeded](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/04/elon-musk-x-trump-far-right).
- One day after the inauguration, Trump, Sam Altman (OpenAI), and Larry Ellison (Oracle) announced [a 500 billion dollar project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe11mJ8mCHU) to build massive data centres in the united states to develop the next generation of AI models.

All of this to say that the tech elite has very clearly–and very quickly!– shown itself to be firmly aligned with the new US administration and its loose affiliation with the truth.  

## Taking your attention back

[[Hank Green]]'s recent [TikTok post](https://www.tiktok.com/@hankgreen1/video/7462834976497601822) has some solid advice in response to all this.

> Take back your attention. Stop giving it away, be intentional what gets put into your brain. The idea that the TikTok algorithm is something you curate–no–it's curating you. \[...\] The attention oligarchy is here – it's been here, obviously– but the brazenness with which thew current party in charge of government in the US is saying they want to reward the attention oligarchs that do what they say and punish those that dont, is new. \[...\] In that situation, you don't win the attention war by fighting the attention war. You win the attention war by ending it. Take back your attention.

That's what I 'm trying to do by writing here (see [[digital garden]]) and by shifting from the oligarch platforms towards the [[Fediverse]]. But man, it's not easy. Compared to Instagram and TikTok, Bluesky and PixelFed feel like ghost towns. But they have chronological feeds, sane moderation, and a really positive community. So onwards I go!
