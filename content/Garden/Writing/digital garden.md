This site is where I am building my [digital garden](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html)

Why keep a digital garden?

- Because writing imposes a slower pace than constantly consuming content. It invites reflection, digestion, and the emergence of new ideas.
- Because writing is a form of thinking. Not only that, it is a way to transmit thoughts between people across time and space. As such, [writing is a form of telepathy](https://alearningaday.blog/2019/06/02/writing-is-telepathy/), which I find pretty cool in and of itself.
- Because I don't know much of anything. But by putting down traces of my current understanding somewhere, I build a foundation I can build upon by revisiting, editing and expanding it, instead of having to rely on my memory and the vague impressions that stay with me after consuming something.
- Because we are all learning. By writing about things *as I learn them* instead of delaying to an indefinite future where I know enough $^{\text{TM}}$, maybe I can produce things that can help others on their own journey.
- Because we are entering an era where most content is kept behind algorithmic gates, and the owners of those gates are [openly flirting with authoritarian figures](https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd). This means that relying on social media platforms to communicate and express oneself is increasingly fraught with risk.
- Because I believe in the power of networks to develop emergent structures, organize complexity, and create new meaning.
- Because it allows me to get lost in a [meandering path of hypertext](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and experience things that are typically familiar as strange and curious.
