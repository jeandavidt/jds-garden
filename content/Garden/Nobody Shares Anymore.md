## My thoughts

Wow, [[Mike Rugnetta]] was *on the ball* --- that video was published 3 years ago, and I feel like I just caught on to this stuff *this week*! I was aware of it, but hadn't clicked in a way that felt real or actionable before. But he is right --- without action, nothing changes. And there is a lot to do!

I never noticed how platforms shifted away from "sharing" and towards a stance that says: "we are here, we are where digital life *happens*. You *will* be here because *we* are here." But it's definitely consistent with them increasingly dominating everyone's communications, discovery of arts and culture, news consumption, and curation of a public persona.
