  abstract = {In the present paper, the effect of liquid properties (surfactants) on bubble generation phenomenon, interfacial area and liquid-side mass transfer coefficient was investigated. The measurements of surface tension (static and dynamic methods), of critical micelle concentration (CMC) and of characteristic adsorption parameters such as the surface coverage ratio at equilibrium (Se) were performed to understand the effects of surfactants on the mass transfer efficiency. Tap water and aqueous solutions with surfactants (cationic and anionic) were used as liquid phases and an elastic membrane with a single orifice as gas sparger. The bubbles were generated into a small-scale bubble column. The local liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (k(L)) was obtained from the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k(L)a) and the interfacial area (a) was deduced from the bubble diameter (D-B), the bubble frequency (f(B)) and the terminal bubble rising velocity (U-B). Only the dynamic bubble regime was considered in this work (Re-OR = 150-1000 and We = 0.002-4). This study has clearly shown that the presence of surfactants affects the bubble generation phenomenon and thus the interfacial area (a) and the different mass transfer parameters, such as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k(L)a) and the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (k(L)). Whatever the operating conditions, the new kLa determination method has provided good accuracy without assuming that the liquid phase is perfectly mixed as in the classical method. The surface coverage ratio (S-e) proves to be crucial for predicting the changes of k(L) in aqueous solutions with surfactants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Based on the concept of hydraulic flocculator, a baffled-channel powdered activated carbon (PAC) contactor, placed before the rapid-mixing basin, was designed and evaluated for removal of taste and odor (T\&O) in drinking water. PAC adsorption kinetic tests for raw water samples were conducted for selection of design parameters related to contact time and degree of mixing. Within the tested range of velocity gradient (G) from 18 to 83s(-1), mixing had a relatively minor effect on the adsorption kinetics of the PAC. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the pilot-scale horizontally and vertically baffled-channel PAC contactor were investigated by tracer tests. It was found that the plug flow fractions of vertically baffled-channel PAC contactor (vBPC) were higher than those of the horizontally baffled-channel PAC contactor (hBPC) for the same bend width or bend height. However, the hBPC seems to be more appropriate than the vBPC in terms of construction and maintenance. The geosmin and MIB removal rate increased with the number of baffles, PAC dose and contact time increased regardless of bend width in the pilot-scale hBPC. The pair of full-scale hBPCs at Pohang water treatment plant, having a design capacity of 6.5 x 10(4) m(3)/d with 20min of hydraulic retention time with a safety factor of 2, was designed based on lab- and pilot-scale experimental results. Under a velocity gradient of 20 s(-1), the number of baffles to be installed was calculated to be 20 with a space of about 2 m between each baffle, resulting in a hydraulic head loss through the contactor of about 0.056 m. The successful application of hBPC for T\&O removal from drinking water supplies should provide momentum for developing more effective treatment methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The performance of reference operation using fixed phase length and dissolved oxygen set points and two real-time control strategies is compared to find optimal operation under dynamic conditions. The results show that a validated model of high quality is obtained using the updated protocol and that the optimization of the system’s performance can be achieved in different manners by implementing the proposed control strategies.},

This technology appears as an alternative to conventional sludge digestion systems. During the batch-mode reaction, high temperatures promote sludge stabilization and pasteurization. The digester temperature is usually the only online, robust, measurable variable. The average temperature can be regulated by manipulating both the air injection and the sludge retention time. An improved performance of diverse biochemical variables can be achieved through proper manipulation of these inputs. However, a better quality of treated sludge usually implies major operating costs or a lower production rate. Thus, quality, production and cost indices are defined to quantify the outcomes of the treatment. Based on these, tradeoff control strategies are proposed and illustrated through some examples. This paper's results are relevant to guide plant operators, to design automatic control systems and to compare or evaluate the control performance on ATAD systems.

  abstract = {The organic compositions of five different sludges and their residues obtained by neutral detergent extraction (NDF) were characterized by pyrolysis-GC/MS, and the composition of their "soluble" fractions was deduced. These organic characteristics were used to explain the observed mineralization when the sludges were added to a soil under controlled conditions. Certain of the biochemical compounds revealed by pyrolysis-GC/MS, such as N-containing compounds, ketones and polysaccharides, were common to all five sludges, but in different proportions. Lignin-derived products were, in contrast, only present in two sludge samples, and were especially abundant in the sludge composted with green wastes and wood pieces. Aliphatic compounds and acids probably originating from lipids were only observed in some of the pyrograms. Although the compositions of the different NDF varied, some global trends were apparent. The sludge NDF pyrolysates contained compounds originating from lignins, cellulosic and non-cellulosic material. Some of the proteins and peptides evidenced by pyrolysis in the total sludge remained after extraction in some residues, although they were expected to be solubilized in neutral detergent. The soluble residue consisted mainly of simple sugars, proteins, peptides and lipids. However, the solubilization of some specific compounds varied with the global composition of the sludge. No specific recalcitrant compounds could be evidenced in the neutral detergent extract. Relationship were established between relative abundance of some compounds and C and N mineralization rates: C mineralization rate after 14 days of incubation was correlated with the cumulated relative areas of (ketones + aliphatics + acids), C mineralization rate at day 168 with those of (phenol + benzene) and N mineralization rate with those of ketones, and N-containing compounds.

The paper presents the modification of a fully operational respirographic biosensor to allow simultaneous and on-line biokinetic characterization of both BOD-removal and nitrification capacities of activated sludge. For this characterization, advantage is taken of the calibration measurements that are performed regularly (every 2-3 h) during normal operation of this biosensor. The injection of a well chosen calibration mixture of readily biodegradable BOD and ammonia to a small activated sludge filled bioreactor results in oxygen uptake rate profiles that are interpreted in the framework of a mathematical model that describes the combined oxygen consumption for BOD removal and nitrification. Model identification gives rise to biokinetic parameters (max. conversion rates and affinity constants) that are indicative of the different metabolic capacities of the activated sludge. It is shown that this information can he used to assess the effect of injected wastewater samples on the sludge condition, e.g. adaptation or inhibition, and allows one to follow the change in relative abundance of heterotrophic and nitrifying populations. Special attention is paid to the proper composition of the calibration solution. Especially the ratio between NOD and BOD is found to be critical. With the aid of simulation, sub-optimal experimental designs are proposed that allow reliable equation of the biokinetic parameters. Fully, validation of the proposed design is given with experimental data.},

  abstract = {This paper makes a critical review of the available techniques for analysing, completing and generating influent data for WWTP modelling. The solutions found in literature are classified according to three different situations from engineering practice: 1) completing an incomplete dataset about the quantity and quality of the influent wastewater; 2) translating the common quality measurements (COD, TSS, TKN, etc.) into the ASM family components (fractionation problem); 3) characterising the uncertainty in the quality and quantity of the influent wastewater. In the first case (Situation 1), generators based on Fourier models are very useful to describe the daily and weekly wastewater patterns. Another specially promising solution is related to the construction of phenomenological models that provide wastewater influent profiles in accordance with data about the catchment properties (number of inhabitant equivalents, sewer network, type of industries, rainfall and temperature profiles, etc.). This option has the advantage that using hypothetical catchment characteristics (other climate, sewer network, etc.) the modeller is able to extrapolate and generate influent data for WWTPs in other scenarios. With a much lower modelling effort, the generators based on the use of databases can provide realistic influent profiles based on the patterns observed. With regard to the influent characterisation (Situation 2), the WWTP modelling protocols summarise well established methodologies to translate the common measurements (COD, TSS, TKN, etc.) into ASM family components. Finally, some statistical models based on autoregressive functions are suitable to represent the uncertainty involved in influent data profiles (Situation 3). However, more fundamental research should be carried out to model the uncertainty involved in the underlying mechanisms related to the wastewater generation (rainfall profiles, household and industries pollutant discharges, assumed daily and weekly patterns, etc.).},

In order to elucidate reasons for this, five natural organic matter (NOM) surrogates were treated using both chlorination and ozonation-chlorination under controlled laboratory conditions. Selected surrogates comprised two phenolic compounds, two free amino acids and one dipeptide; these were resorcinol, 3-aminophenol, L-aspartic acid, beta-alanine and ala-ala, respectively. Quantified DBPs included chloropicrin, chloroform, dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetonitrile. Relative to chlorination alone, increases in the formation of chloropicrin from ozonation-chlorination varied from 138\% for 3-aminophenol to 3740\% for ala-ala for the four amine surrogates. This indicates that ozone is more effective than chlorine in mediating a rate-limiting oxidation step in chloropicrin formation, most plausibly involving conversion of an amine group to a nitro group. While both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surrogates acted as chloropicrin precursors, ala-ala was the most reactive precursor following ozonation-chlorination. Since peptides are far commoner in drinking water sources than free amino acids, further research into chemical oxidation of these species by ozone and chlorine is recommended. In contrast, oxidation with ozone prior to chlorination reduced chloroform formation moderately for the two phenolic compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The study was carried out in a full scale water treatment plant. Results indicate that mixed oxidants favor humic to non-humic conversion of natural organic matter. Primary treatment preferentially removes the more hydrophobic fraction. This converted the non-humic fraction in an important source of disinfection by-products with a 20\% contribution to the final trihalomethane formation potential (THMFPF) of the finished water. Enhanced coagulation at 40 mg l−1 of polyaluminium chloride with a moderate mixing intensity (80 rpm) and pH of 6.0 units doubled the removal efficiency of THMFPF achieved at full scale plant. However, gel permeation chromatography data revealed that low molecular weight fractions were still hardly removed. Addition of small amounts of powdered activated carbon, 50 mg l−1, allowed reduction of coagulant dose by 50\% whereas removal of THMFPF was maintained or even increased. In systems where mixed oxidants are used addition of powdered activated carbon allows complementary benefits by a further reduction in the THMFPF compared to the conventional only coagulation–flocculation–settling process.},

  abstract = {Air vacuum processes with venturi, simple in design and easy to operate, have been used in a wide variety of industrial and water/waste water treatment applications in environmental engineering. The air vacuum process occurs when a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet regions of a venturi device. This paper introduces an air vacuum process within a venturi device and its relationship with the Reynolds number. In this case study, air vacuum characteristics such as volumetric air flowrate were studied, depending on water flowrate. An empirical correlation for air vacuum with a venturi device is presented to predict the volumetric air flowrate (Q(a)) as a function of water flowrate (Q(w)), diameter of throat (d(2)), diameter of air vent or suction port (d(h)) and Reynolds number (Re). A minimal Reynolds number for absorption of air is observed in the transition flow region for the inlet of a venturi device (Re {$>$}= 1900) and in the turbulent flow region for the throat of a venturi (Re {$>$}= 3900).},

Faecal sludge from 16 VIP latrines within the eThekwini Municipality was collected and laboratory characterisation including moisture content, total and volatile solids, chemical oxygen demand, and aerobic biodegradability was performed. Sludge samples were collected from 4 specific depths within each pit investigated. The laboratory characterisation performed showed that none of the VIP latrines investigated had the same sludge characteristics, and that within a pit sludge characteristics varied with increasing depth in the pit. This supports the motivating hypothesis that, depending on household habits and local environmental conditions, there should be considerable variation in the organic contents, moisture content, non-biodegradable content and microbial population between different pits. This variation with increasing depth within a pit is expected, since fresh material is constantly being added to the pit overlaying older material which might have undergone a certain degree of stabilisation.},

  abstract = {Plunging water jet flow situations are frequently encountered in nature and environmental engineering. A plunging liquid jet has the ability to provide vigorous gas-liquid mixing and dispersion of small bubbles in the liquid, and enhances mass transfer rate by producing larger gas-liquid interfacial area. This process is called air-entrainment or aeration by a plunging water jet. Advances in field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer opportunities of utilizing new algorithms and models. This study presents Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) model, which is an extension to genetic programming, as an alternative approach to modeling of volumetric air entrainment rate by plunging water jets. A new formulation for prediction of volumetric air entrainment rate by plunging water jets using GEP is developed. The GEP-based formulation and ANN approach are compared with experimental results, Multiple Linear/Nonlinear Regressions (MLR/NMLR) and other equations. The results have shown that the both ANN and GEP are found to be able to learn the relation between volumetric air entrainment rate and basic water jet properties. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed and it is found that nozzle diameter is the most effective parameter on the volumetric air entrainment rate among water jet velocity, jet length and jet impact angle.},

The dosage of Fe(NO3)(3) had a significant effect on performance of the ATAD process and a dosage gradient of Fe(NO3)(3) equivalent to 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg/L for the removal of acetic acid was adopted. The lowest concentrations of total VFA (TVFA) and VFAs but highest content of ATP were found in the digester with a dosage of Fe(NO3)(3) equivalent to 1000 mg/L removal of acetic acid (D2) and VS removal of 40.28\% was obtained in D2 after 14 days digestion, which achieved stabilization 7 days earlier than the digester without any additions. Furthermore, VS removal of 45.51\% was observed after 21 days digestion in D2. Hence, chemical precipitation with Fe(NO3)3 was an effective method for disinhibition of VFAs in ATAD when dosage of Fe(NO3)(3) equivalent to 1000 mg/L removal of acetic acid was added on the 6th day.

The oxygen concentration in surface waters is a prime indicator of the quality of that water for human use as well as use by the aquatic biota. When a water jet impinges a pool of water at rest, air bubbles may be entrained and carried a way below the pool free surface. This process is called plunging water jet entrainment and aeration. In this paper, air entrainment rate and oxygen transfer efficiency of venturi device with air holes along the length of the convergent-divergent passage was studied experimentally, and in particular, the effect of varying numbers, positions, and open/close status of the air holes. A negative pressure drew air in through holes at the convergent-divergent passage of the venturi device. This phenomenon affected the water jet expansion, the air entrainment rate, and the bubble penetration depth and hence the oxygen transfer efficiency. It was demonstrated that the values of air entrainment rate and the oxygen transfer efficiency of the venturi device were significantly higher than those of the circular nozzle.},

The first phase of the program established the rate of degradation as function of temperature level and the rate of biological heat generation caused by endogenous respiration. Using this information and recognizing that the single major heat loss in the process using air is caused by the unavoidable humidification of the large quantities of gas required, it was hypothesized that by using covered reactors and oxygen one can obtain elevated temperatures even under most adverse climatic conditions. The project determined, in addition to the temperature dependency, the effect of the type of sludge (waste activated or a mixture of primary and waste activated) on the degradation rate. A kinetic model for digestion was developed. An extensive pilot plant study was performed.},

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was fractionated for two objectives: delineation of the limits of the activated sludge process being used at the plant, and evaluation of the potential environmental impact of the treated effluent. Physico-chemical analyses, respirometric and biodegradation tests, as well as COD fractionation were carried out. Molasses-wastewaters were determined to be the major contribution to the plant. The influent was dark brown in color, with a relatively high content of both organics (2503 mg/L COD) and salts (5459 mu S/cm conductivity), but a low biochemical oxygen demand (568 mg/L BOD5) and BOD5/COD ratio (0.24). The degradability of the organics was limited by the high content of inert soluble COD (S-I). The COD fractionation pattern was 40-20-40\% for S-I, X-I (inerts) and S-H (soluble hydrolyzable), respectively. More than 90\% BOD5 removal was obtained, which was sufficient for the plant to meet the national Standards. However, the effluent discharged into the river was intensely colored and polluted ({$>$}1000 mg/L COD, {$>$}5000 mu S/cm), emphasizing the need for legislation regulating COD, color and salinity, and for upgraded treatment methods worldwide for molasses wastewaters.

  abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice , the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

  abstract = {A case study was conducted to evaluate and identify the main materials and sources affecting the conductivity of reclaimed industrial wastewater for reuse. There were two suppliers (food production companies, S and M) and two users (pulp and paper making companies, P1 and P2). The user requirements for quality of the reclaimed water were conductivity {$<$}1,000 μS/cm and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) {$<$}10 mg/L. Conductivity of treated wastewater at M company varied from 872 to 1620 μS/cm, but the VSS was very stable over the year, with an average of 5 mg/L. According to the source tracking of M company, it was determined that the main materials affecting conductivity were TDS, Ca2+, and Na+. Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurement is sometimes the only practical method for the analysis of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS); therefore, developing this relationship would be helpful for company-to-company wastewater reuse. In this case study, the ratio of TDS to EC was in the range of 0.58–0.67, with a mean value of 0.64 and a very strong relationship at the effluent point. Even though the results were from only one industry, this conversion factor could be used to estimate TDS using EC measurements for similar industrial wastewater and could motivate further research for the direct use of treated industrial wastewater. This study is a first case study of company-to-company wastewater reuse.},

Results showed that the removal efficiencies of COD, TN and TP in AG-MBR were 98\%, 89\% and 58\%, respectively as compared to 98\%, 74\% and 38\%, respectively in SG-MBR. Improved TN removal in AG-MBR systems was primarily based on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process. These results infer that the presence of small bio-particles having higher microbial activity and the growth of complex biomass captured within the suspended sponge carriers resulted in improved TN and TP removal in AG-MBR.},

  abstract = {Half of the world's urban population will live in informal settlements or 'slums' by 2030. Affordable urban sanitation presents a unique set of challenges as the lack of space and resources to construct new latrines makes the de-sludging of existing pits necessary, and this is something that is currently done manually, with significant associated health risks. Various mechanised technologies have therefore been developed to facilitate pit emptying, with the majority using a vacuum system to remove material from the top of the pit. However, this results in the gradual accumulation of unpumpable sludge at the bottom of the pit, which eventually fills the latrine and forces it to be abandoned. This study has developed a method for fluidising unpumpable pit latrine sludge, based on laboratory experiments using a harmless synthetic sludge. The implications for sludge treatment and disposal are discussed, and the classification of sludges according to the equipment required to remove them from the latrine is proposed. Finally, further work is suggested, including the ongoing development of a device to physically characterise latrine sludge in-situ within the pit.},

  abstract = {Reports of pharmaceuticals in STPs and aquatic systems in the northern hemisphere have surged over the last decade. However, the Australian evidence base is relatively limited, and information on the role of seasonal dilution in attenuation of micropollutants is also scarce. We investigated the removal of 11 PPCPs during sewage treatment in Australia's largest inland STP, and concentrations in the effluent-receiving environment under 2 dilution scenarios. Five treatment stages were sampled, as well as upstream and downstream of the effluent outfall in the Lower Molonglo/Upper Murrumbidgee Catchment, which is dominated by effluent flow during dry periods. Compounds of interest include carbamazepine (CBZ), venlafaxine (VEN), sertraline (SER), fluoxetine (FLX), atenolol (ATL), sotalol (SOT), metoprolol (MET) propranolol (PRL), chlorpheniramine (CHP), diphenhydramine (DPH), and triclosan (TCS). Removal of most pharmaceuticals in the STP was incomplete, although the degree of removal was highly variable for compounds in the same therapeutic class, and for the same compounds in different seasons. Removal efficiency was highest for TCS and lowest for VEN (effluent concentrations 5–7 times higher than influent). Influent mass loads and removal efficiencies of cardiovascular medicines varied considerably. Effluent loads were highest for CBZ, VEN and SOT in both seasons (up to 64 g/day). The dilution conditions were clearly reflected in the ‘zone of impact’ of PPCPs in the catchment. This study confirms that risk assessment models for PPCPs must account for seasonality of influent loads and removal efficiency of STPs, and site validation is critical for predictive capability. Seasonal dilution can play an important role in ameliorating potentially adverse effects related to mixtures of PPCPs in effluent-impacted systems.},

  abstract = {This present paper proposes new investigations aiming at: (i) studying the effect on oxygen diffusion coefficients of the presence in clean water of some compounds usually encountered in biological media and (ii) quantifying their consequences on liquid-side mass transfer coefficients. The oxygen diffusion coefficients D were firstly measured in various synthetic liquid phases containing either salt (NaCl), sugar (glucose) or surfactant (sodium laurylsulphate). When compared to clean water, noticeable reductions of D were observed: the variation of D with the compound concentration C was modelled and found dependent on the nature of the compound added. In a second time, using the same liquid media, experiments on a train of bubbles rising in a quiescent liquid phase were carried out to determine the associated liquid-side mass transfer coefficients (k(L)). For all cases, as for diffusion coefficients, a decrease of k(L) with increasing C was clearly observed whatever the aqueous solutions. These findings firstly showed that, even if the properties of clean water (density, viscosity, surface tension) were not significantly changed by the addition of salts (NaCl), the liquid-side mass transfer coefficients could be, all the same, modified. For the aqueous solutions of glucose, the reduction of k(L) with diffusion coefficients D was well correlated, and mainly due to the change in viscosity with concentration. For surfactants, the hydrodynamic conditions (i.e. bubble Reynolds number) being almost kept constant for all concentrations, only the change in oxygen diffusion coefficients was thus responsible for the decrease of k(L). The present study clearly confirmed the need to complete and/or account for the database related to oxygen diffusion coefficients in complex media, this condition being imperatively required to describe and to model appropriately the gas-liquid mass transfer phenomena.

The influent chemical oxygen demand Fractions can substantially influence the results of simulation-based design such as reactor volumes, solids residence time, effluent quality. oxygen demand, Sludge production, etc. This article attempts to give an overview of wastewater organic fractions as modeling parameters and presents new chemical oxygen demand fractionation results from Hungary. According to the data from literature, the ratio of chemical oxygen demand components in raw wastewater is very different and the average composition is as follows: Inert particulate = 17.1 \%, slowly biodegradable = 57.9 \%, inert soluble = 7.8 \% and readily biodegradable = 17.5 \%. The Hungarian wastewater samples were analyzed according to STOWA (Dutch foundation For applied water research) protocol and (he obtained results were not much different from those of literature ( inert particulate = 23.7 \%, slowly biodegradable = 49.8 \%, inert soluble = 4.6 \% and readily biodegradable = 21.9 \%), but some typical characteristics were observed.},

In the present study, liquid-film-forming apparatus is successfully developed on a laboratory scale to improve considerably the surface transfer via the unique liquid film transfer technique. The experimental results show that the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for liquid-film-forming apparatus alone is found to be as much as 5.3 times higher than that for water surface and that the total volumetric mass transfer coefficient for liquid film aeration system increases by 37 \% in comparison with conventional aeration system. Additionally, by tuning finely the structural parameters of the liquid-film-forming apparatus, it can also lead to high dissolved oxygen water with the dissolved oxygen percent saturation greater than 90 \%. More importantly, this result is accomplished by simply offering a single-pass aeration at the depth as shallow as 26 cm. As a result, the objective of economical energy consumption in diffused aeration systems can be realized by lowering the aeration depth without sacrificing the aeration efficiency.},

The liquid-side mass transfer coefficient, kL, and the specific interfacial area, a, are studied individually. The specific interfacial area is obtained using the new automatic image analysis technique developed by Ferreira et al. (2012). The experimental results of volumetric liquid side mass transfer coefficient (kLa), Sauter mean diameter (d32) and gas holdup (εG), and the calculated values of a and kL, are correlated with the superficial gas velocity and the power density (P/V), in order to be used in scale-up processes and in comparisons with the literature. The results show that kLa increases with both superficial gas velocity and oscillatory conditions, the last ones having the highest impact on the mass transfer process. The increase in the oscillation motion (frequency and amplitude) results in bubble size reduction (from \textasciitilde 7mm, without oscillation, to \textasciitilde 1mm, with oscillation), in bubble average residence time increase and, consequently, in a increase. A kL increase with d32 decrease is observed, showing the importance of hydrodynamic phenomena on kL, specially, when very low bubbles sizes are presented in oscillatory flow reactors.},

We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

  abstract = {A short review of different respirometric methods is presented, and advantages and disadvantages of different principles are discussed. In this study a combined respirometric–titrimetric set-up was applied to monitor the degradation processes during batch experiments with activated sludge. The respirometer consists of an open aerated vessel and a closed non-aerated respiration chamber. It is operated with two oxygen probes resulting in two sources of information on the oxygen uptake rate; both collected at a high frequency. The respirometer is combined with a titrimetric unit that keeps the pH of the activated sludge sample at a constant value through the addition of acid and/or base. The cumulative amount of added acid and base serves as a complementary information source on the degradation processes. Interpretation of respirometric data resulting from validation experiments (additions of acetate and urea as ammonium source) showed that the set-up provided reliable data. Data interpretation was approached in two ways: (1) via a basic calculation procedure, in which the oxygen uptake rates were obtained by an oxygen mass balance over the respiration chamber, and (2) via a model-based procedure in which substrate transport was included for a more accurate data interpretation. Simulation examples showed that the presence of substrate transport in the model may be crucial for a correct data interpretation, since experimental conditions (e.g. low flow rate) and/or the biodegradation kinetic parameters (e.g. high KS) may otherwise lead to data interpretation errors. Earlier studies already pointed out that titrimetric data can be related to nitrification, and this was also confirmed in this study. However, in addition, it was shown here for experiments with acetate that the amount of acid dosed was clearly related to the amount of acetate degraded. This indicates that the titrimetric data can be used to study the carbon source degradation. For the titrimetric data in this study, a model-based analysis was however only applied for the nitrification process. For an experiment with ammonium, it was illustrated that the estimation of biodegradation kinetics on a combined respirometric–titrimetric data set significantly improves confidence intervals of the parameters compared to the parameter estimation based on respirometric or titrimetric data separately.},

In this paper, a method for the continuous estimation of the STOD is described. The method is based on the measurement of three different oxygen uptake rates of the activated sludge: endogenous respiration rate, momentary respiration rate and actual respiration rate. Measurement of the latter needs special experimental conditions. The respirometer used is a Wazu respiration meter which is capable of continuous and on-line measuring the oxygen uptake rate.The method was applied to a completely mixed continuous-flow pilot plant which was fed with domestic wastewater. The results show a varying STOD with significant peaks at about noon, indicating higher concentrations of readily biodegradable compounds. The STOD of the examined wastewater appears to be mainly caused by ammonia being oxidized by nitrifiers.},

An excellent example is the control of automobile exhaust emissions, made possible by the use of oxygen gas sensors. Since early 1970's there have been sustained studies on oxygen sensors and has led to development of sensors for various applications with varying performance characteristics. Solid electrolyte based potentiometric, amperometric and metal oxide based semiconducting resistive type sensors are used for high temperature applications. For solution-based pollution monitoring, dissolved oxygen sensors based on Clark electrodes have played a major role. More recently, for biological and medical applications, optical oxygen sensors are beginning to have an impact. In this review, we focus on both high temperature as well as dissolved oxygen sensors and compare the different methods of oxygen sensing, discuss underlying principles, and outline the designs and specific applications.

  abstract = {Activated sludge systems have been applied for 100 years now. Over the course of the years, researchers have developed various models to describe activated sludge processes. The main aim has been to gain a better understanding of the conditions that favour the conversions of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus present in wastewater, and associated oxygen consumption and sludge production. The current paper presents a reflection on the historical developments, state-of-the-art of activated sludge modelling and future trends. Over the years, many wastewater research groups have benefitted greatly from the development of activated sludge models (ASMs). On one hand, modelling has been expanded through the development of novel theoretical concepts and their application in new fields. On the other hand, models have been used for practical projects. Although, scientists are still searching for the ideal model, one can say that ASMs are developed to the extent that they can be applied in practice with confidence. New developments are expected to be seen regarding plant-wide modelling, integration with other models at the (urban) system level, organizational and computational infrastructure, and interface and communication with various stakeholders and users.}

A general nitrification process model, which is valid for any realistic flow pattern, is used to develop the estimation algorithm. Depending on the measurements available, two estimation equations are derived. While both require measuring the nitrification activity of the activated sludge, one requires the additional measurement of the nitrifiable nitrogen concentrations at the two ends of the bioreactor, and the other requires the nitrate nitrogen concentrations at the same locations. The algorithm also requires some stoichiometric and kinetic parameters. However, sensitivity analysis shows that the estimate is insensitive to the parameters other than the autotrophic decay rate. Compared to the existing algorithms, the algorithm developed in this article does not rely on the assumption of ideal flow pattern in the plant and does not require an error-prone estimate of the autotrophic biomass concentration. Experimental and simulation studies show that the algorithm performs well and is robust to influent variations and accidental sludge losses.},

Since ASM2d usually is overparameterized with respect to the available data, the subset of calibration parameters is not unique. In practice, calibration of ASM2d (and other ASMs) is often addressed by ad hoc selecting and tuning procedures. In this paper, a more systematic approach based on parameter identifiability analysis of parameter subsets is applied. The approach consists of a preliminary prior parameter analysis and a subsequent iterative parameter subset selection and tuning procedure. The former includes the choice of suitable prior parameter values and uncertainties and a pre-selection of parameters which are reasonably estimated from the data available. The latter is based on three diagnostic measures which are simple to calculate and easy to interpret. It is demonstrated as to how these measures can be used to identify the most important model parameters and to analyze their interdependencies. In addition, it is shown how these measures facilitate the analysis of the influence of fixed parameter values on parameter estimates. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this work, a new respirometric method is proposed, in order to estimate readily biodegradable COD, slowly biodegradable COD, and the active heterotrophic biomass present in a wastewater, necessary for modelling and upgrading the biological treatment processes. As the initial conditions of the batch procedures proposed need to be adapted to each sewage under study, the presented method is based on the combination of two experiments, at high and low So/Xo ratio (initial ratio between wastewater and biomass in gCOD/gVSS). The first ones are obtained by direct aeration of wastewater without sludge addition, and the second by mixing wastewater sample with an excess aerated sludge volume, at low So/Xo, in the range 0.01-0.2 gCOD/gVSS. The use of a biological model and an identification procedure allows simultaneous estimations to be made of the kinetic parameters and the initial concentrations in COD biodegradable fractions, and of the active heterotrophic biomass. Firstly, assuming that the yield coefficient is known (Y(H)), the structural identifiability of the COD fractions is proved. Then it is shown that the combination of two experiments with the same sample allows the readily biodegradable COD concentration to be clearly identified, and greatly improves the estimation of the hydrolysable fraction of COD, dividing by three the standard deviation of the results. The determination of heterotrophic biomass concentration is obtained from the same respirograms, but need a simplified interpretation for some experiments. Concerning the French sewage studied (12 samples), the concentration of heterotrophic biomass measured in (around 23\% of total COD) is high compared with classical data. The same wastewater contains a readily biodegradable COD concentration varying from 6 to 14\% of total COD, and a hydrolysable fraction in the range 41-66\%. These results are compared with those obtained by the classical flow- through method and good agreement is shown between the two procedures. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Here, the practical identifiability of model parameters was investigated via evaluation of the output sensitivity functions and the corresponding Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). It appeared that the FIM was not sufficiently powerful to predict the practical identifiability of this case with combined measurements as parameters could indeed be identified despite the fact that the FIM became singular. The accuracy of parameter estimates based on respirometric and titrimetric data and combination thereof was also investigated. Estimation on titrimetric data (Hp) was very accurate and a fast convergence of the objective function towards a minimum was obtained. The latter also holds for estimation on oxygen uptake rate data (rO), however with a lower accuracy. Parameter estimation based on oxygen concentration data (SO) was more complex but resulted in a higher accuracy. Thus, when the highest accuracy is needed it is recommended to estimate parameters initially on Hp and/or rO data, and to subsequently use these parameters as initial values for final, and more accurate estimation on SO data.},

  abstract = {Bio-process modelling is increasingly used in design, modification and troubleshooting of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Characterisation of the influent wastewater to a WWTP is an important part of developing such a model. The characterisation required for modelling is more detailed than that routinely employed for monitoring WWTP operation. Wastewater characteristics depend on the sources within the catchment served by a particular WWTP, and the presence of industrial effluents can cause the wastewater to be significantly different from purely domestic effluent. eThekwini's wastewater treatment system is one of those most affected by industrial effluents in South Africa. Where industrial pollutants cause particular problems, additional measurements, beyond those standardly applied in sewage treatment, are required. Since influent characteristics vary from one catchment to another, this paper presents and compares results of influent wastewater characterisation from three municipal WWTPs, two of which are operated by eThekwini Water Services, which receive a combination of industrial and domestic wastewater. The paper also presents efforts to fractionate the influent COD of another WWTP run by eThekwini municipality and receiving a complex mixture of industrial and domestic effluent. The influent characterisation involves the determination of the volumes and concentrations of the carbonaceous, nitrogenous and phosphorus fractions in the wastewater, as well as other constituents present in the wastewater. This paper focuses on the carbonaceous fraction in the wastewater.},

To achieve this, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) biological nutrient removal (BNR) activated sludge system was operated. From batch tests on mixed liquor drawn from the MBR BNR system, denitrification and phosphorus removal rates were delineated. Additionally the influence of the high total suspended solids concentrations present in the MBR BNR system and of the limitation of substrate concentrations on the kinetics was investigated. Moreover the ability of activated sludge in this kind of system to denitrify under anoxic conditions with simultaneous phosphate uptake was verified and quantified. The denitrification rates obtained for different mixed liquor (ML) concentrations indicate no effect of ML concentration on the specific denitrification rate. The denitrification took place at a single specific rate (K-2) with respect to the ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHOs, i.e. non-PAOs) active mass. Similarly, results have been obtained for the P removal process kinetics: no differences in specific rates were observed for different ML or substrate concentrations. From the P removal batch tests results it seems that the biological phosphorus removal population (PAO) consists of 2 different sets of organisms denitrifying PAO and aerobic PAO.},

In some investigations, it was found that the P release and uptake were confined exclusively ({$>$}95\%) to the anaerobic and aerobic reactors respectively and the observed P removal conformed to the BEPR model of Wentzel er al. In these investigations, due to an absence of anoxic P uptake (substantiated by PHB measurements), it could be inferred that the phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) did not significantly contribute to the denitrification. The ordinary heterotrophic organism (OHO) and PAO groups were separated with the aid of the BEPR model of Wentzel er ai. Ascribing the denitrification to the OHO group performing this process, the specific rates of denitrification associated with the utilization of slowly biodegradable COD (SBCOD) in the primary (K-2') and secondary (K-3') anoxic reactors were calculated and compared with the rates in ND systems (K-2 and K-3). In other investigations it was found that P release and uptake were not confined exclusively to the anaerobic and aerobic reactors respectively and the observed P removal was only about 60\% of that expected from the BEPR model of Wentzel et al. In these investigations significant P uptake under anoxic conditions was observed so the PAOs may have been involved with the denitrification. However, the denitrification rates were calculated as before by attributing it exclusively to the OHOs. Widely varying K-2' rates were observed at 20 degrees C, ranging from 0.071 to 0.335 mgNO(3)-N/(mgAHVSS.d). The variation in K' rates is mainly due to widely varying OHO active fraction estimates for NDBEPR systems. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A closed, intermittent-flow device has been set-up for the measurement of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and parameter calibration. After describing the device structure and operation, the factors affecting accuracy have been assessed. Inaccuracies may be caused by two groups of parameters: design parameters, including flow rate, volume, sampling time, numerical algorithm, sample injection and environmental parameters, concerning the physicochemical conditions of the experiment, such as unwanted oxygen transfer, pH, and the influence of sludge condition on ``start-up\{''\} behaviour. It is shown to what extent each of them affects the final accuracy of the OUR measurement. In the second part of the paper, the respirometric data are used to calibrate a two-step nitrification model and their impact on the accuracy of the estimation of model parameters is assessed. Confidence limits are derived for the identifiable parameter combinations and the practical identifiability assessed with the aid of trajectory sensitivity analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in biological enhanced phosphorus (bio-P) removal has hindered the successful development of this technology for wastewater treatment. The major objective of this research (Comeau, 1984) was to propose a model that would explain the bio-P removal phenomena under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The model presented here is based on the observations made with bio-P removal processes and on principles of microbial biochemistry. Bio-P bacteria are defined as being responsible for bio-P removal and are proposed to be capable of both po1yphosphate (polyP) and po1y-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage.Under anaerobic conditions (absence of both free oxygen and nitrate - Fig. 1) available substrates such as acetate (HAc) will be transported across the membrane by facilitated diffusion. Under usual conditions of pH, most of the acetate will be in the anionic form (Ac- ) and one H+of the proton motive force1 will be required for Ac- intracellular transport. Once inside Ac- can then be stored as PHB. It is postulated that the mechanism by which polyP confers an advantage to bio-P bacteria for PHB accumulation is by re-estab1ishing the pmf in order to allow more Ac- to be transported across the membrane and be stored. If the pH gradient of the pmf was not re-estab1ished no more Ac- could be accumulated. The pmf is proposed to be re-estab1ished by polyP which provides a source of phosphate molecules that can be neutrally transported across the plasma membrane. Once outside, phosphate molecules will dissociate and the released protons (H+) will re-establish the pmf and H+ can be used again for acetate transport.The source of energy required to metabolize acetate into acetyl CoA could possibly come from polyP breakdown. For acetyl CoA to be stored as PHB, a source of NADH is required. NADH can be produced anaerobically from acetyl CoA utilization by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle which functions at a reduced rate under these conditions.Under subsequent aerobic conditions (Fig. 2) bio-P bacteria now have the advantage of a reserve of PHB that can be used for energy production while any available substrate in solution is heavily competed for by other aerobic bacteria. Energy is produced aerobically from PHB via acetyl CoA metabolized in the TCA cycle to produce NADH which is oxidized at the electron-transport chain (ETC) in the presence of oxygen (or nitrate) in order to expel protons and thus establish the pmf. The pmf is used to form ATP which can be converted to polyP for storage. The availability of PHB can result in a high intracellular ATP to ADP ratio. Thus polyP can be accumulated and bio-P bacteria can grow and multiply.Therefore, the proper sequencing of environmental conditions in the waste treatment reactors results in anaerobic exposure to simple substrates such as acetate which are stored with the assistance of polyP. This is followed by aerobic conditions where polyP accumulates and phosphorus is removed from the wastewater. The proposed models were found to provide not only very satisfactory explanations for the observed phenomena related to bio-P removal, but were also found to be of a very valuable predictive power to assess the pertinence of a design or of an operational modification for upgrading a bio-P treatment plant (Comeau, 1984).1The proton motive force (pmf) is composed of a charge gradient and of a pH gradient across the plasma (inner) membrane of bacteria which is impermeable to ions (notably to H+).

By following the guidelines, a sufficiently detailed and practical characterisation is obtained, and the results can be used for simulation studies on treatment plants for process optimisation, trouble-shooting and design assistance. At present, five years of experience is gained with the guidelines and they were used for the simulation of circa 100 treatment plants. The guidelines are evaluated as simple and easy to implement in routine analysis programs.},

For the application of this model kinetic parameters and wastewater composition must be known. A simple method to estimate kinetic parameters of heterotrophic biomass and COD wastewater fractions is presented. With three different types of batch-tests these parameters and fractions can be determined by measuring oxygen respiration. Our measurements showed that the maximum specific growth rate µmax of heterotrophic biomass depends on temperature, reactor configuration and SRT. In typical wastewater treatment plants of Switzerland the amount of readily biodegradable substrate was generally small (about 9 \% of the COD in primary effluent). The same method can also be used to determine kinetic parameters of nitrifying biomass.},

The addition of nitrification inhibitor is avoided by applying a calibrated nitrification model to the respiration rate data resulting from both heterotrophic and autotrophic degradation. Furthermore, a new procedure is developed for simultaneous assessment of decay coefficients for heterotrophic and autorophic biomass. The results show that, for a given wastewater/sludge combination S/X can be crucial in obtaining reliable parameter estimates: at a very low ratio not all parameters could be identified. A higher ratio caused problems because of nitrification inhibition.},

The presented method is valuable for detailed monitoring of the nitrification process in a reactor: it is simple, inexpensive, robust and generally applicable for nitrifying reactor systems. The measurement of NH+4 and NO−2 oxidation rates enables the operator to detect the presence of NH+4 and NO−2 species. This allows action to be taken to improve the performance of the system. The method is validated on a SBR. It is indicated that optimal SBR phase scheduling can be based on such OUR measurements.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) can be formed during biological nitrogen (N) removal processes. In this work, a mathematical model is developed that describes N(2)O production and consumption during activated sludge nitrification and denitrification. The well-known ASM process models are extended to capture N(2)O dynamics during both nitrification and denitrification in biological N removal. Six additional processes and three additional reactants, all involved in known biochemical reactions, have been added. The validity and applicability of the model is demonstrated by comparing simulations with experimental data on N(2)O production from four different mixed culture nitrification and denitrification reactor study reports. Modeling results confirm that hydroxylamine oxidation by ammonium oxidizers (AOB) occurs 10 times slower when NO(2)(-) participates as final electron acceptor compared to the oxic pathway. Among the four denitrification steps, the last one (N(2)O reduction to N(2)) seems to be inhibited first when O(2) is present. Overall, N(2)O production can account for 0.1-25\% of the consumed N in different nitrification and denitrification systems, which can be well simulated by the proposed model. In conclusion, we provide a modeling structure, which adequately captures N(2)O dynamics in autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification driven biological N removal processes and which can form the basis for ongoing refinements.},

  abstract = {Conventional models for predicting the fate of xenobiotic organic trace chemicals, identified, and calibrated using data obtained in batch experiments spiked with reference substances, can be limited in predicting xenobiotic removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). At stake is the level of model complexity required to adequately describe a general theory of xenobiotic removal in WWTPs. In this article, we assess the factors that influence the removal of diclofenac and carbamazepine in activated sludge, and evaluate the complexity required for the model to effectively predict their removal. The results are generalized to previously published cases. Batch experimental results, obtained under anoxic and aerobic conditions, were used to identify extensions to, and to estimate parameter values of the activated sludge modeling framework for Xenobiotic trace chemicals (ASM-X). Measurement and simulation results obtained in the batch experiments, spiked with the diclofenac and carbamazepine content of preclarified municipal wastewater shows comparably high biotransformation rates in the presence of growth substrates. Forward dynamic simulations were performed using full-scale data obtained from Bekkelaget WWTP (Oslo, Norway) to evaluate the model and to estimate the level of re-transformable xenobiotics present in the influent. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that xenobiotic loading conditions can significantly influence the removal capacity of WWTPs. We show that the trace chemical retransformation in upstream sewer pipes can introduce considerable error in assessing the removal efficiency of a WWTP, based only on parent compound concentration measurements. The combination of our data with those from the literature shows that solids retention time (SRT) can enhance the biotransformation of diclofenac, which was not the case for carbamazepine. Model approximation of the xenobiotic concentration, detected in the solid phase, suggest that between approximately 1\% and 16\% of the total solid carbamazepine and diclofenac concentrations, respectively, is due to sorptionthe remainder being non-bioavailable and sequestered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model's predictive power over conventional tools in a statistical analysis, performed at four levels of structural complexity. To assess WWTP retrofitting needs to remove xenobiotic trace chemicals, we suggest using mechanistic models, e.g., ASM-X, in regional risk assessments. For preliminary evaluations, we present operating charts that can be used to estimate average xenobiotic removal rates in WWTPs as a function of SRT and the xenobiotics mass loads normalised to design treatment capacity.

  abstract = {Recently a model was introduced to interpret the respirometric (OUR) -titrimetric (Hp) data obtained from aerobic oxidation of different carbon sources in view of calibration of Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1). The model requires, among others, the carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR) to be relatively constant during aerobic experiments. As CTR is an inherently nonlinear process, this assumption may not hold for certain experimental conditions. Hence, we extended the model to describe the nonlinear CTR behavior. A simple calibration procedure of the CO2 model was developed only using titrimetric data. The identifiable parameter subset of this model when using titrimetric data only contained the first equilibrium constant of the CO2 dissociation, pK(1) the initial aqueous CO2 concentration, C-Tinit and the nitrogen content of biomass, i(NBM). The extended model was then successfully applied to interpret typical data obtained from respirometric-titrimetric measurements with a nonlinear CO2 stripping process. The parameter estimation results using titrimetric data were consistent with the results estimated using respirometric data (OUR) alone or combined OUR and Hp data, thereby supporting the validity of the dynamic CO2 model and its calibration approach. The increased range of applicability and accurate utilization of the titrimetric data are expected to contribute particularly to the improvement of calibration of ASM models using batch experiments.

  abstract = {In activated sludge processes, several plant configurations (like plug-flow configuration of the aeration tanks, systems with selectors, contact-stabilization processes or SBR processes) impose a concentration gradient of the carbon sources to the biomass. As a consequence, the biomass grows under dynamic (unbalanced) conditions and a storage response is usually established without any necessity of other external limitations (e.g. lack of nutrients or oxygen accepters). Under such conditions, the storage is often the main mechanism of removal of readily available substrates, even though other mechanisms can also contribute to substrate removal, depending on the microbial composition and the previous ``history\{''\} of the biomass. In this paper the type and the extent of this dynamic response is discussed by review of experimental studies on pure cultures, mixed cultures and activated sludges and with main reference to its relevance on population dynamics in the activated sludge. Possible conceptual approaches to storage modelling are also presented, including both structured and unstructured modelling. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A systematic procedure for selecting identifiable parameter subsets for a given set of measured outputs is proposed. The aim is to only select those parameters which can be estimated uniquely from the dataset used. The proposed procedure consists of first selecting a reduced set of most sensitive parameters by sensitivity analysis and subsequently selecting identifiable parameter subsets using the Fisher information matrix. For a particular set of outputs obtained from a typical calibration exercise at a carrousel-type nitrogen removal plant, parameter subsets ranging from two to eight parameters were selected by this procedure. The procedure proved successful as the parameter subsets thus selected could be estimated accurately from simulated data without and with noise as well as from real data. However, the procedure is based on a property which is local in parameter space. Consequently, as an a priori assumption on the parameter vales has to be made at the start of the procedure, the selection results might be different from the results which would have been obtained by using the a posteriori parameter values. Hence, the sensitivity towards this a priori assumption was tested explicitly. For this purpose, the parameter space was sampled according to a Latin hypercube sampling scheme and the selection procedure was applied in all sampling points as if these were a priori estimates. From this extensive study it could be concluded that the results of the procedure were not too severely influenced by the a priori assumption on the parameter values. Therefore, the proposed procedure appears to be a powerful and practical tool for efficient and reliable model calibration. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

First of all, fast structure characterization methods are presented allowing us to track the model structure on-line. Since these so-called a priori methods are less computing intensive, they carl be at the basis of optimal experimental design calculations that can be performed on-line, This allows us to maintain the quality of the overall model identification under the changing process conditions of a wastewater treatment plant.

It is highlighted that the changing nature of both wastewater and activated sludge enforces the continuous adjustment of the proposed In-Sensor-Experiments to maintain the quality of the sensor's outputs. Central to the automated design of the experiments performed in these adaptive sensors is a mathematical representation of the processes occurring in the device. This model is continuously updated on the basis of previously acquired data. It is illustrated how different design criteria (objective functions), such as most reliable model selection capability or minimal parameter variance, influence the experimental designs. The concepts are illustrated with real-life data from two types of In-Sensor-Experiments. First short-term (fed-)batch respirometric experiments are used to estimate the biokinetics of the nitrifying population. Second, a new device is presented in which a sensing element is placed at the end of a plug-flow reactor, hence the term `'Plug-Flow-Sensor''. The optimally designed and continuously updated variation of the flow rate through the plug flow reactor results in a retention time distribution. This allows us to monitor a variable as function of the reaction time and this within a narrow (user-specified) window of reaction times, increasing the measuring frequency and accuracy compared to equivalent batch experiments. As a first example, ORP is applied as measured variable. By using ORP `'nitrate knees'' can be detected after a certain reaction time. This information is an indicator of the denitrifying capacity of the sludge.},

The carbon dioxide evolution rate (CER) was determined in a respirometer by infrared analysis associated to a modelling technique. During anoxic and aerobic batch experiments CER was qualitatively correlated with other respirometric methods (OUR and NUR) and with organic carbon consumption. Yield coefficients were determined under aerobic (Y-H) and anoxic (Y-HD) conditions by means of carbon balances using CER and organic carbon measurements. Compared to the COD balances, accuracy of the yield estimation was improved and results obtained were not significantly different. Measured anoxic yields were systematically lower than aerobic ones, and the observed ratios between them were in the range from 0.66 to 0.85. By comparing aerobic and anoxic CER two methods were proposed to determine the correction factor for anoxic growth tie The first results obtained were consistent with those given by the classical method (NUR/OUR).

Then, an identifiability and observability study, given measurements of MLVSS (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids) and respiration rate, is performed for use under practical circumstances, such as in state and parameter estimation. It appears that the process is observable, but not fully identifiable. Hence, for the identification of some of the model parameters, additional measurements or experiments, also indicated here, have to be performed. Furthermore, it is shown that, under quasi-steady state conditions which, in general, appear shortly after initialization of an endogenous respiration experiment, the model can be reduced significantly. Finally, results of parameter estimation from available data are presented and discussed. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Furthermore, chemometric techniques, valuable tools to extract the relevant data, are also referred. To that effect, a detailed analysis is performed for aerobic and anaerobic systems to summarize the findings that have been obtained since 2000.

  abstract = {An activated sludge model for greenhouse gases no. 1 was calibrated with data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) without control systems and validated with data from three similar plants equipped with control systems. Special about the calibration/validation approach adopted in this paper is that the data are obtained from simulations with a mathematical model that is widely accepted to describe effluent quality and operating costs of actual WWTPs, the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The calibration also aimed at fitting the model to typical observed nitrous oxide (N2O) emission data, i.e., a yearly average of 0.5 \% of the influent total nitrogen load emitted as N2O-N. Model validation was performed by challenging the model in configurations with different control strategies. The kinetic term describing the dissolved oxygen effect on the denitrification by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was modified into a Haldane term. Both original and Haldane-modified models passed calibration and validation. Even though their yearly averaged values were similar, the two models presented different dynamic N2O emissions under cold temperature conditions and control. Therefore, data collected in such situations can potentially permit model discrimination. Observed seasonal trends in N2O emissions are simulated well with both original and Haldane-modified models. A mechanistic explanation based on the temperature-dependent interaction between heterotrophic and autotrophic N2O pathways was provided. Finally, while adding the AOB denitrification pathway to a model with only heterotrophic N2O production showed little impact on effluent quality and operating cost criteria, it clearly affected N2O emission productions.},

  abstract = {Biological nitrogen removal is susceptible to disturbances in activated sludge processes. Significant improvement of performances are obtained by controlling the process taking into account wastewater modifications and sludge activity. In this work a specific sensor is developed, based on oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements performed in a completely mixed reactor which can be the activated sludge basin itself. This reactor is continuously fed by wastewater and sludge issued from the recirculation stream of the process, and submitted to alternating aeration. DO profiles and ORP bending point are linked to nitrification and denitrification in the sensor. Signal dynamics are treated with a physical model for simultaneously estimating nitrifiable nitrogen concentration in wastewater, nitrification rate, and denitrification rate. Results show very good prediction of experimental oxygen profiles and the software sensor allows us to recalculate nitrate and ammonia profiles in the reactor with a good accuracy. The estimation of nitrifiable nitrogen and removal rates has been validated experimentally. The system allows us to follow highly variable influent nitrogen concentration, toxic events, and changes in the COD concentration or quality in wastewater.},

Based on a short overview on the theoretical biochemistry knowledge this review should help model users to better understand (i) the model concepts used; (ii) the differences between models, and (iii) the limits of the models. The seven analyzed models are: (1) ASM1; (2) ASM2d; (3) ASM3; (4) ASM3?+?BioP; (5) ASM2d?+?TUD; (6) Barker \& Dold model; and (7) UCTPHO+. Nine standard processes are distinguished and discussed in the present work: hydrolysis; fermentation; ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHO) growth; autotrophic nitrifying organisms (ANO) growth; OHO \& ANO decay; poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) storage; polyphosphate (polyP) storage; phosphorus accumulating organisms PAO) growth; and PAO decay. For a structured comparison, a new schematic representation of these processes is proposed. Each process is represented as a reaction with consumed components on the left of the figure and produced components on the right. Standardized icons, based on shapes and color codes, enable the representation of the stoichiometric modeling concepts and kinetics. This representation allows highlighting the conceptual differences of the models, and the level of simplification between the concepts and the theoretical knowledge. The model selection depending on their theoretical limitations and the main research needs to increase the model quality are finally discussed. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 2446.

  abstract = {This paper illustrates the modelling of a full-scale industrial wastewater treatment plant, First, the hydraulics of the plant were characterised by a model-based interpretation of the results of a tracer test. The plant consists of three parallel reactors. The hydraulics of each reactor could be modelled by two tanks in series with non-equal volume. These results were confirmed by calculation of the single pass residence time distribution. Also it was found that the influent flow and the recycle flow were not distributed equally to the three reactors,resulting in different loading rates. Secondly, off-line respirometric experiments were performed to characterise the influent and to determine the sludge kinetics. The same model structure could be applied to describe the influent characteristics and the biokinetics over a period of 1 year. It was found that all wastewaters could be fractionated into three fractions and that one of the fractions was acetate-like. Concentrations of the fractions changed significantly over the year. From on-line respirometric experiments the diurnal dynamics of the influent characteristics and the kinetics of the sludge were assessed. Analysis of the respirograms showed that the wastewater composition and kinetics of the sludge did not change significantly over;a short-term period of 40 hours.

We construct a new procedure for generating a variety of flow balanced random networks to test the role that the network structure has on the city's ability to constructively destroy exergy, the useful component of energy in a process. We consider two network types, Erdos-Renyi and scale-free networks, and illustrate how these types, and the various realizations of these types as defined by their control parameters, impact the quantity of exergy destroyed. Specifically we find that the Erdos-Renyi network is best equipped to destroy exergy, but that the scale-free network provides more certainty in this ability for networks that are sparsely connected. This trade-off between the exergy destruction and certainty is observed in a study of Toronto. Overall the findings suggest that the selection of network topology in the development of open systems is an important factor (among others) in the successful development of open systems, their sustainability, and their ability to achieve maximum work extraction from energy imports.

A nonlinear model is tested against historical data for two cities, Hong Kong and Singapore. A robust fit is obtained for Hong Kong, with energy for maintenance close to that for growth, while Singapore, with a weaker fit, is growth dominated. The findings suggest that decreases in either of the per unit maintenance or growth demands can simultaneously cause gross domestic product (GDP) and total energy use to increase. Furthermore, increasing maintenance demands can significantly limit growth in energy demand and GDP. Thus, the low maintenance demands for Hong Kong, and especially Singapore, imply that, all other things being equal, GDP and energy use of these cities will continue to grow, though Singapore's higher energy use for growth means it will require more energy than Hong Kong.}

The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.},

Water-energy problems are of increasing significance in the case of water shortages, more elevated energy and material costs, and a varying climate. In this economic context, it is vital for utilities to manage performances, both in water and energy utilization. Carrying out energy audits (EAs) at water and wastewater treatment facilities is one method community energy managers may recognize favorable occasions to save water, energy and money. In this review, the significance of energy utilization in wastewater facilities is shown by a case study of a process EA performed for Crested Butte, Colorado's wastewater treatment plant. The EA detected favorable occasions for crucial energy savings (ESs) by examining power intensive unit processes like influent pumping, aeration, ultraviolet disinfection, and solids handling. This case study shows best practices that may be easily applied by facility managers in their search for energy and financial savings in water and wastewater treatment. This article aims to ameliorate community energy managers' comprehension of the action that the water and wastewater sector performs in a community's total energy consumption. The energy efficiency roadmaps defined give information on ESs favorable occasions, which may be employed as a fundamental concept for treating energy management objectives with water and wastewater treatment facility managers.

  abstract = {The paper proposes an approach to designing the control structure and algorithms for optimising control of integrated wastewater treatment plant-sewer systems (IWWTS) tinder a full range of disturbance inputs. The optimised control of IWWTS allows for significant cost savings, fulfilling the effluent discharge limits over a long period and maintaining the system in sustainable operation. Due to the specific features of a wastewater system a hierarchical control structure is applied. The functional decomposition leads to three control layers: supervisory, optimising and follow-tip. A temporal decomposition that is applied in order to efficiently accommodate the system's multiple time scales leads to further decomposition of the optimising control layer into three control sublayers: slow, medium, and fast. An extended Kalman Filter is used to carry out an estimation of needed but not measured plant states in real time. The robustly feasible model predictive controller produces manipulated variable trajectories based on a dedicated grey box (GB) model of the biological processes and drawing its physical reality from the well known ASM2d model. The GB model parameters are dependant on the plant operating point and therefore are continuously estimated. As it is impossible to efficiently control the plant under all influent conditions that may occur by using one universal control strategy, different control strategies are designed. Recently developed mechanisms for soft switching between the MPC control strategies are applied in order to smooth the state and control transient processes during the switching. The methodologies and algorithms proposed in the paper are validated by simulation based on real data records from a wastewater system located in Kartuzy, northern Poland. The control system was implemented at the case-study site to generate in real time the control actions that were assessed by the plant operators and verified by simulation based on a calibrated plant model.

Although exact knowledge of influent changes during rain/storm events is unrealistic, we take advantage of the fact that during dry weather conditions the influent changes are periodic and thus predictable. Specifically, a nonlinear optimization procedure utilizes dry weather data to decide on a nominal fixed setpoint, or a weighting gain, or both; during weather events an algorithm uses the optimization solution(s) together with the ammonium predictions to adjust the setpoint dynamically (responding appropriately to significant changes in the influent). A constrained nonlinear neural-network model predictive control tracks the setpoint. Simulations with the BSM1 compare several variations of the proposed methods to a fixed-setpoint PI control, demonstrating improvement in effluent quality or reduction in energy use, or both.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group Dewatering of faecal sludge (FS) is indispensable for adequate FS management. However, comprehensive knowledge is lacking on FS dewatering performance. This study compared the dewatering performance of FS from different countries and onsite sanitation technologies, to assess influential characteristics on dewatering, and to compare dewatering performance of FS with wastewater sludge. We collected 73 FS samples from septic tanks, lined pit latrines, unlined pit latrines and johkasou tanks in Uganda, Vietnam and Japan, and 18 samples of wastewater sludge in Switzerland. Capillary suction time (CST) and total solids (TS) of centrifuged sludge (\%TS final ) were determined as metrics of dewatering rate and dewaterability, respectively, together with relevant sludge characteristics. Data were analysed by bootstrapping comparison of median results of each sample category and by bootstrapping multiple regression analysis to quantify the relative importance of sludge characteristics on dewatering performance. Results showed that the dewatering rate was significantly different between FS from different technologies, whereas dewaterability was significantly different within the same technology. FS had a significantly lower dewatering rate than wastewater sludge. In contrast, FS dewaterability was greater than wastewater sludge. However, this could be attributed to higher concentrations of sand in FS. Electrochemical properties such as NH 4 -N and surface charge had the strongest correlation to dewatering rate, and solid properties such as sand content and total volatile solids to dewaterability. The results identify potential characteristics that could explain and predict the high variability of FS dewatering performance that is observed in the field.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art understanding of activated sludge processes as summarized in activated sludge models (ASMs) predicts an instantaneous increase in the biomass activity (which is measured, e.g., by the corresponding respiration rate OUR, NUR, etc.) under sudden substrate concentration changes. Experimental data (e.g., short-term batch respiration experiments under aerobic or anoxic conditions) collected for the calibration of the dynamic models (ASMs) often exhibit a transient phenomenon while attaining maximum activity, which cannot be explained by the current understanding of the activated sludge process. That transient phenomenon exhibits itself immediately upon addition of a substrate source to an endogenously respiring activated sludge sample and it usually takes a few minutes until the activated sludge reaches its maximum possible rate under given environmental conditions. This discrepancy between the state-of-the-art model and the experimental data is addressed in detail in this investigation. It is shown that the discrepancy is not caused by an error in the experimental set-up/data but it is rather due to model inadequacy. Among the hypotheses proposed, it appears that this transient response of the activated sludge most likely results from the sequence of intracellular reactions involved in substrate degradation by the activated sludge. Results from studies performed elsewhere with pure cultures (S. cerevisae and E. coli) support the hypothesis. The transient phenomenon can be described by a dynamic metabolic network model or by a simple first-order model, as adopted in this study. The transient phenomenon occurring in short-term batch respiration experiments is shown to interfere severely with parameter estimation if not modeled properly (2.8\%, 11.5\%, and 16.8\% relative errors \{[\}average of three experiments] on Y-H, mu(maxH), and K-S, respectively). Proper modeling of this transient phenomenon whose time constant is on the order of minutes (1 to 3 min) is expected to contribute fundamentally to a better understanding and modeling of Orbal, carousel, and SBR-type treatment plants with fast-alternating process conditions, although such studies are beyond the scope of this report.

In this variant, pure oxygen is introduced as a step input to a batch freed from any dissolved gas by e.g. vacuum desorption. All the data obtained by this method agree with those measured by the steady state sulphite method and conform to a simple relation of the form kℓa ∼ en1.

  abstract = {This paper introduces two types of nonsmooth optimization methods for selecting model hyperparameters in primal SVM models based on cross-validation. Unlike common grid search approaches for model selection, these approaches are scalable both in the number of hyperparameters and number of data points. Taking inspiration from linear-time primal SVM algorithms, scalability in model selection is achieved by directly working with the primal variables without introducing any dual variables. The proposed implicit primal gradient descent (ImpGrad) method can utilize existing SVM solvers. Unlike prior methods for gradient descent in hyperparameters space, all work is done in the primal space so no inversion of the kernel matrix is required. The proposed explicit penalized bilevel programming (PBP) approach optimizes both the hyperparameters and parameters simultaneously. It solves the original cross-validation problem by solving a series of least squares regression problems with simple constraints in both the hyperparameter and parameter space. Computational results on least squares support vector regression problems with multiple hyperparameters establish that both the implicit and explicit methods perform quite well in terms of generalization and computational time. These methods are directly applicable to other learning tasks with differentiable loss functions and regularization functions. Both the implicit and explicit algorithms investigated represent powerful new approaches to solving large bilevel programs involving nonsmooth loss functions.},

Data-driven methods have proven their applicability to modeling complex and non-linear hydrological processes. This paper presents a novel visual modeling system that has been developed to overcome the problems involved in implementation of data-driven models for hydrological forecasts using conventional programming languages: problems such as the effort and skill needed to program the models, the lack of reusability of existing models, and the lack of shared tools to perform tedious tasks such as preprocessing data. The system provides an integrated visual modeling environment within which users are able to graphically design and verify specific forecasting models for particular problems without writing code. A set of popular data-driven models are offered by the system. Plug-in models created by wrapping existing code are also allowed to run within the system due to the system's open architecture. The system's feasibility and capability is demonstrated through a case study of forecasting 1-day ahead flow in a river basin located in China. The encouraging simulation results show that the system can simplify the process of implementing hydrological forecast.}

Our study aims to address this issue by developing a set of clearly understandable metrics to assess the performance of sewer deterioration models from an end-user perspective. The developed metrics are used to benchmark the performance of a statistical model, namely, GompitZ based on survival analysis and Markov-chains, and a machine learning model, namely, Random Forest, an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. The models have been trained with the extensive CCTV dataset of the sewer network of Berlin, Germany (115,258 inspections). At network level, both models give satisfactory outcomes with deviations between predicted and inspected condition distributions below 5\%. At pipe level, the statistical model does not perform better than a simple random model, which attributes randomly a condition class to each inspected pipe, whereas the machine learning model provides satisfying performance. 66.7\% of the pipes inspected in bad condition have been predicted correctly. The machine learning approach shows a strong potential for supporting operators in the identification of pipes in critical condition for inspection programs whereas the statistical approach is more adapted to support strategic rehabilitation planning.}

ELM is a newly introduced fast method and here we show a novel application of this method in monthly streamflow forecasting. ELM may not work well for a large number of input variables. Therefore, an input selection is applied to overcome this problem. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of ANN trained by backpropagation (BP) and ELM algorithm using initial input selection was found to be 0.66 and 0.72, respectively, for the test period. However, when wavelet transform, and then genetic algorithm (GA)-based input selection are applied, the test NSE increase to 0.76 and 0.86, respectively, for ANN-BP and ANN-ELM. Similarly, using singular spectral analysis (SSA) instead, the coefficients are found to be 0.88 and 0.90, respectively, for the test period. These results show the importance of input selection and superiority of ELM and SSA over BP and wavelet transform. Finally, a proposed multistep method shows an outstanding NSE value of 0.97, which is near perfect and well above the performance of the previous methods.}

They are flexible, conceptually simple and straightforward, but provide only average measures of uncertainty based on past data. However, if one needs to estimate uncertainty of a model in a particular hydro-meteorological situation in real time application of complex models, Monte Carlo simulation becomes impractical because of the large number of model runs required. This paper presents a novel approach to encapsulating and predicting parameter uncertainty of hydrological models using machine learning techniques. Generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation method (a version of the Monte Carlo method) is first used to assess the parameter uncertainty of a hydrological model, and then the generated data are used to train three machine learning models. Inputs to these models are specially identified representative variables. The trained models are then employed to predict the model output uncertainty which is specific for the new input data. This method has been applied to two contrasting catchments. The experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning models are quite accurate. An important advantage of the proposed method is its efficiency allowing for assessing uncertainty of complex models in real time.}

Due to high computational cost of the SPSO-MODSIM model, we have, subsequently, used four meta-model types of artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), kriging and polynomial response functions, replacing the MODSIM DSS, in an adaptively learning meta-modeling approach. The performances of the meta-models are first compared in two Ackley and Dejong benchmark functions optimization problems, and the meta-models are then evaluated by solving the Atrak river basin water allocation optimization problem in Iran. The results demonstrate that independent of the meta-model type, the sequentially space-filling meta-modeling approach can improve the performance of meta-models in the course of optimization by adaptively locating the promising regions of the search space where more samples need to be generated. However, the ANN and SVM meta-models perform better than others in saving the number of costly, original objective function evaluations.}

A respirometric method is presented that performs short batch experiments, so-called In-Sensor-Experiments for toxicity detection. Two types of wastewater samples can be added to the reactor in the device: either the potentially toxic wastewater entering the plant, or, a defined mixture of acetate and ammonia. From the latter experiments models are identified that describe the heterotrophic and autotrophic activity of the sludge. Since these 'calibration' experiments are alternated with experiments in which wastewater is injected, the effect of the wastewater on the sludge can be quantified unequivocally. Full-scale toxicity detection (and the corresponding effluent quality) results are reported for a plant treating a mixture of hospital and municipal wastewaters. The respirometer was installed at the influent line of the plant. It was evaluated during a 6-month period for its on-line toxicity detection capacity. Both deliberate and accidental intoxications were recorded and compared with off-line toxicity measurements. Inhibitory wastewaters affected the nitrification activity of the sludge. This was confirmed by the concomitant increase in NH4+discharge of the treatment plant. To evaluate the efficiency of control actions, the deliberate addition of toxicant was interrupted at the time a toxicity alarm was triggered by the respirometer. It was observed that plant performance then remained unaffected for all monitored criteria.},

By measuring dissolved oxygen, scientists determine the quality of water and health of an ecosystern. Oxygen enters water by entrainment of air bubbles. Many industrial and environmental processes involve the aeration of a liquid by such entrainment of air bubbles. Venturi aeration is a method of aeration that has become popular in recent years. When a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of a venturi tube, a vacuum (air suction) occurs at the suction holes of the venturi tube. The present paper describes the effect of Reynolds Number, air inlet hole diameter, inlet diameter, pipe length, and angle of pipe downstream of the venturi tube, on the air injection rate. It is observed from the results that venturi tubes have high air injection efficiencies. Therefore, venturi tubes can be used as highly effective aerators in ponds, lakes, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc.},

In spite of their hydraulic, temporal, and spatial connections, water and wastewater pipeline systems are traditionally planned and designed in a stationary and separated manner. This practice may have, in the early stages, already rooted future system operational risk. An integrated model was developed to evaluate the performance of these two systems, planned and designed according to the traditional water demand quota approaches adopted in China. The integrated model included an agent-based water end-use model to generate water demand and wastewater discharge, which was used to drive a water distribution system model and a drainage system model, both developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In a case study in Beijing, the proposed model forecasted lower water demand and wastewater discharge, leading to oversized water systems designed by the traditional approach. However, the greater diurnal fluctuations would cause operational problems during the peak hour, as well as off-peak periods, in both pipeline systems. Vulnerable hotspots for urban water services were thus identified and potential mitigation options discussed.},

  abstract = {To make water quality monitoring networks useful for practice, the automation of data collection and data validation still represents an important challenge. Efficient monitoring depends on careful quality control and quality assessment. With a practical orientation a data quality assurance procedure is presented that combines univariate off-line and on-line methods to assess water quality sensors and to detect and replace doubtful data. While the off-line concept uses control charts for quality control, the on-line methods aim at outlier and fault detection by using autoregressive models. The proposed tools were successfully tested with data sets collected at the inlet of a primary clarifier, where probably the toughest measurement conditions are found in wastewater treatment plants.},

  abstract = {The recent availability and affordability of sensors and wireless communications is poised to transform our understanding and management of water systems. This will enable a new generation of adaptive water models that can ingest large quantities of sensor feeds and provide the best possible estimates of current and future conditions. To that end, this paper presents a novel data-driven identification/learning toolchain for combined sewer and stormwater systems. The toolchain uses Gaussian Processes to model dry-weather flows (domestic wastewater) and dynamical System Identification to represent wet-weather flows (rainfall runoff). By using a large and high-resolution sensor dataset across a real-world combined sewer system, we illustrate that relatively simple models can achieve good forecasting performance, subject to a finely-tuned and continuous re-calibration procedure. The data requirements of the proposed toolchain are evaluated, showing sensitivity to spatial heterogeneity and unique time-scales across which models of individual sites remain representative. We identify a near-optimal time record, or data “age,” for which historical measurements must be available to ensure good forecasting performance. We also show that more data do not always lead to a better model due to system uncertainty, such as shifts in climate or seasonal wastewater patterns. Furthermore, the individual components of the model (wet- and dry-weather) often require different volumes of historical observations for optimal forecasting performance, thus highlighting the need for a flexible re-calibration toolchain rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.},

Its primary purpose has been to create a platform for control strategy benchmarking of biological wastewater treatment processes. The fact that the benchmark has resulted in more than 100 publications, not only in Europe but also worldwide, demonstrates the interest for such a tool in the research community. In this paper, an extension of the benchmark simulation model no. 1 (BSM1) is proposed. It aims at facilitating evaluation of two closely related operational tasks: long-term control strategy performance and process monitoring performance. The motivation for the extension is that these two tasks typically act on longer time scales. The extension proposed here consists of 1) prolonging the evaluation period to one year (including influent files), 2) specifying time varying process parameters and 3) including sensor and actuator failures. The prolonged evaluation period is necessary to obtain a relevant and realistic assessment of the effects of such disturbances. Also, a prolonged evaluation period allows for a number of long-term control actions/handles that cannot be evaluated in a realistic fashion in the one week BSM1 evaluation period. In the paper, models for influent file design, parameter changes and sensor failures, initialization procedure and evaluation criteria are discussed. Important remaining topics, for which consensus is required, are identified. The potential of a long-term benchmark is illustrated with an example of process monitoring algorithm benchmarking.},

Typical studies focus on recognition of faulty data with a given set of installed sensors on a wastewater treatment plant. Little attention is however given to how one can install sensors in such a way that fault detection and identification can be improved. In this work, we develop a method to obtain Pareto optimal sensor layouts in terms of cost, observability, and redundancy. Most importantly, the resulting method allows reducing the large set of possibilities to a minimal set of sensor layouts efficiently for any wastewater treatment plant on the basis of structural criteria only, with limited sensor information, and without prior data collection. In addition, the developed optimization scheme is fast. Practically important is that the number of sensors needed for both observability of all flows and redundancy of all flow sensors is only one more compared to the number of sensors needed for observability of all flows in the studied wastewater treatment plant configurations.}

  abstract = {Analytic models are developed for optimizing bus services with time dependence and elasticity in their demand characteristics. Some supply parameters, i.e. vehicle operating costs and speeds are also allowed to vary over time. The multiple period models presented here allow some of the optimized system characteristics (e.g. route structure) to be fized at values representing the best compromise over different time periods, while other characteristics (e.g. service headways) may be optimized within each period. In a numerical example the demand is assumed to fluctuate over a daily cycle (e.g. peak, offpeak and night), although the same models can also be used for other cyclical or noncyclical demand variations over any number of periods. Models are formulated and compared for four types of conditions, which include steady fixed demand, cyclical fixed demand, steady equilibrium demand and cyclical equilibrium demand. When fixed demand is assumed, the optimization objective is minimum total system cost, including operator cost and user cost, while operator profit and social welfare are the objective functions maximized for equilibrium demand. The major results consist of closed form solutions for the route spacings, headways, fares and costs for optimized feeder bus services under various demand conditions. A comparison of the optimization results for the four cases is also presented. When demand and bus operating characteristics are allowed to vary over time, the optimal functions are quite similar to those for steady demand and supply conditions. The optimality of a constant ratio between the headway and route spacing, which is found at all demand densities if demand is steady, is also maintained with a multi-period adjustment factor in cyclical demand cases, either exactly or with a relatively negligible approximation. These models may be used to analyze and optimize fairly complex feeder or radial bus systems whose demand and supply characteristics may vary arbitrarily over time. ?? 1991.},

  abstract = {Parallel hybrid modeling methods are applied to a full-scale cokes wastewater treatment plant. Within the hybrid model structure, a mechanistic model specifies the basic dynamics of the relevant process and a non-parametric model compensates for the inaccuracy of the mechanistic model. First, a simplified mechanistic model is developed based on Activated Sludge Model No. 1 and the specific process knowledge of the cokes wastewater treatment process. Then, the mechanistic model is combined with five different non-parametric models - feedforward back-propagation neural network, radial basis function network, linear partial least squares (PLS), quadratic PLS and neural network PLS (NNPLS) - in parallel configuration. These models are identified with the same data obtained from the plant operation to predict dynamic behavior of the process. The performance of each parallel hybrid model is compared based on their ease of model building, prediction accuracy and interpretability. For this application, the parallel hybrid model with NNPLS as non-parametric model gives better performance than other parallel hybrid models. In addition, the NNPLS model is used to analyze the behavior of the operation data in the reduced space and allows for fault detection and isolation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is a new breakthrough in machine learning, and differentiates from the conventional or shallow learning algorithms by emulating the six-layer human neocortex, which is unique for human brain containing billions of interconnected neurons. Unlike canonical ANN, DL is capable of self-learning data features by mimicking the self-learning functions layer by layer in human cortex and creating a data-driven model with the given dataset. This paper reports the initial applications of deep learning for simulation, optimization and operation control of water distribution systems. It elaborates the development of efficient deep learning framework with potential applications of facilitating the data fusion, system simulation and predictive analysis, detection of abnormal events from the recorded time series data (pressures, flows and consumptions etc.), water usage prediction, construction of a meta-model as a surrogate to the physics-based models (hydraulic and water quality), and acceleration of the solution search for smart water distribution management, which aims at improving operation efficiency, reducing carbon footprint, and exceling customers’ expectation.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL) technology, summarizes recent developments in this area, and discusses their potential implications for the field of process control, and more generally, of operational decision-making. The paper begins with an introduction to RL that allows an agent to learn, through trial and error, the best way to accomplish a task. We then highlight new developments in RL that have led to the recent wave of applications and media interest. A comparison of the key features of RL and mathematical programming based methods (e.g., model predictive control) is then presented to clarify their similarities and differences. This is followed by an assessment of several ways that RL technology can potentially be used in process control and operational decision applications. A final section summarizes our conclusions and lists directions for future RL research that may improve its relevance for the process systems engineering field.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic, genetic programming and model trees were found to be four successfully employed modeling techniques. The results show that well-known ANNs such as multilayer perceptron and radial basis function can predict membrane fouling with an R 2 equal to 0.99 and an error approaching zero. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are optimization methods successfully applied to optimize parameters related to membrane fouling. These optimization techniques indicated high capabilities in tuning various parameters such as transmembrane pressure, crossflow velocity, feed temperature, and feed pH. The results of this survey demonstrate that hybrid intelligent models utilizing intelligent optimization methods such as GA and PSO for adjusting their weights and functions perform better than single models. Clustering analysis, image recognition, and feature selection are other employed intelligent techniques with positive role in the control of membrane fouling. The application of AI and ML techniques in an advanced control system can reduce the costs of treatment by monitoring of membrane fouling, and taking the best action when necessary.},

The objective of this study is to enhance biogas production in industrial facilities by designing a graphical user interface to machine learning models capable of predicting biogas output given a set of waste inputs. The methodology involved applying predictive algorithms to daily production data from two major Chinese biogas facilities in order to understand the most important inputs affecting biogas production. The machine learning models used included logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors regression. The models were tuned and cross-validated for optimal accuracy. Our results showed that: (1) the KNN model had the highest model accuracy for the Hainan biogas facility, with an 87\% accuracy on the test set; (2) municipal fecal residue, kitchen food waste, percolate, and chicken litter were inputs that maximized biogas production; (3) an online web-tool based on the machine learning models was developed to enhance the analytical capabilities of biogas project operators; (4) an online waste resource mapping tool was also developed for macro-level project location planning. This research has wide implications for biogas project operators seeking to enhance facility performance by incorporating machine learning into the analytical pipeline.},

However, few studies have systematically analyzed the optimal hydraulic retention times (HRTs) in anaerobic and aerobic reactions, or whether these are the most appropriate control strategies. In this study, a novel optimization methodology using an improved Q-learning (QL) algorithm was developed, to optimize An/Ae HRTs in a BPR system. A framework for QL-based BPR control strategies was established and the improved Q function, Qt+1(st,st+1)=Qt(st,st+1)+k·[R(st,st+1)+γ·maxatQt(st,st+1)−Qt(st,st+1)] was derived. Based on the improved Q function and the state transition matrices obtained under different HRT step-lengths, the optimum combinations of HRTs in An/Ae processes in any BPR system could be obtained, in terms of the ordered pair combinations of the {$<$}current state-transition state{$>$}. Model verification was performed by applying six different influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations, varying from 150 to 600 mg L−1 and influent P concentrations, varying from 12 to 30 mg L−1. Superior and stable effluent qualities were observed with the optimal control strategies. This indicates that the proposed novel QL-based BPR model performed properly and the derived Q functions successfully realized real-time modelling, with stable optimal control strategies under fluctuant influent loads during wastewater treatment processes.},

However, big data in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is widely underutilized, due in part to a workforce that lacks background knowledge of data science required to fully analyze the unique characteristics of WWTP. Wastewater treatment processes exhibit nonlinear, nonstationary, autocorrelated, and co-correlated behavior that (i) is very difficult to model using first principals and (ii) must be considered when implementing data-driven methods. This review provides an overview of data-driven methods of achieving fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced control of WWTP. We present how big data has been used in the context of WWTP, and much of the discussion can also be applied to water treatment. Due to the assumptions inherent in different data-driven modeling approaches (e.g., control charts, statistical process control, model predictive control, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy logic), not all methods are appropriate for every goal or every dataset. Practical guidance is given for matching a desired goal with a particular methodology along with considerations regarding the assumed data structure.

This paper reviews several data-driven approaches which play a key role in bringing forward a sea change. It critically investigates whether data-driven UWM offers a promising foundation for addressing current challenges and supporting fundamental changes in UWM. We discuss the examples of better rain-data management, urban pluvial flood-risk management and forecasting, drinking water and sewer network operation and management, integrated design and management, increasing water productivity, wastewater-based epidemiology and on-site water and wastewater treatment. The accumulated evidence from literature points toward a future UWM that offers significant potential benefits thanks to increased collection and utilization of data. The findings show that data-driven UWM allows us to develop and apply novel methods, to optimize the efficiency of the current network-based approach, and to extend functionality of today's systems. However, generic challenges related to data-driven approaches (e.g., data processing, data availability, data quality, data costs) and the specific challenges of data-driven UWM need to be addressed, namely data access and ownership, current engineering practices and the difficulty of assessing the cost benefits of data-driven UWM.},

Charting appropriate mitigation responses requires information on the costs of mitigating versus 20 associated damages for the two levels of warming. In this assessment, a critical consideration is the 21 impact on crop yields and yield variability in regions currently challenged by food insecurity. The current 22 23 study assessed impacts of 1.5°C versus 2.0°C on yields of maize, pearl millet and sorghum in the West 24 African Sudan Savanna using two crop models that were calibrated with common varieties from 25 experiments in the region while management reflected a range of typical sowing windows. As 26 sustainable intensification is promoted in the region for improving food security, simulations were 27 28 conducted for both current fertilizer use and for an intensification case (fertility not limiting). With 29 current fertilizer use, results indicated 2\% units higher losses for maize and sorghum with 2.0°C 30 compared to 1.5°C warming, with no change in millet yields for either scenario. In the intensification 31 32 case, yield losses due to climate change were larger than with current fertilizer levels. However, despite 33 the larger losses, yields were always 2-3 times higher with intensification, irrespective of the warming 34 scenario. Though yield variability increased with intensification, there was no interaction with warming 35 scenario. Risk and market analysis are needed to extend these results to understand implications for 36 37 food security.},

In addition, the extent-based modeling strategy is enhanced by optimal accounting for nonlinear algebraic equilibria and nonlinear measurement equations. Finally, a thorough discussion of our results explains the benefits of extent-based modeling and its potential to turn environmental process modeling into a highly automated task.}

It is popularly studied for exploratory data analysis and online process monitoring. Unfortunately, fine-tuning PCA models and particularly the number of components remains a challenging task. Today, this selection is often based on a combination of guiding principles, experience, and process understanding. Unlike the case of regression, where cross-validation of the prediction error is a widespread and trusted approach for model selection, there are no tools for PCA model selection enjoying this level of acceptance. In this work, we address this challenge and evaluate the utility of the cross-validated ignorance score with both simulated and experimental data sets. Application of this model selection criterion is based on the interpretation of PCA as a density model, as in probabilistic principal component analysis. With simulation-based benchmarking, it is shown to be (a) the overall best performing criterion, (b) the preferred criterion at high noise levels, and (c) very robust to changes in noise level. Tests on experimental data sets suggest that the ignorance score is sensitive to deviations from the PCA model structure, which suggests the criterion is also useful to detect model-reality mismatch.},

This severely limits the applicability of this approach. In this work, we propose a novel procedure for parameter estimation inspired by the existing extent-based framework. A key difference with prior work is that the proposed procedure combines structural observability labeling, matrix factorization, and graph-based system partitioning to split the original model parameter estimation problem into parameter estimation problems with the least number of parameters. The value of the proposed method is demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and a study based on a historical data set collected to characterize the isomerization of a-pinene. Most importantly, the obtained results indicate that an important barrier to the application of extent-based frameworks for process modeling and monitoring tasks has been lifted.},

Decision support systems (DSS) have been used widely for handling such complexity in water treatment, having a high level of popularity as academic exercises, although little validation and few full-scale implementations reported in practice. The objective of this paper is to review the application of artificial intelligence methods (mainly machine learning) to UWS and to investigate the integration of these methods into DSS. The results of the review suggest that artificial neural networks is the most popular method in the water and wastewater sectors followed by clustering. Bayesian networks and swarm intelligence/optimization have shown a spectacular increase in the water sector in the last 10 years, being the latest techniques to be incorporated but overtaking case-based reasoning. Whereas artificial intelligence applications to the water sector focus on modelling, optimization or data mining for knowledge generation, their encapsulation into functional DSS is not fully explored. Few academic applications have made it into decision making practice. We believe that the reason behind this misuse is not related to the methods themselves but rather to the disassociation between the fields of water and computer engineering, the limited practical experience of academics, and the great complexity inherently present.},

  abstract = {Sensor maintenance is time-consuming and is a bottleneck for monitoring on-site wastewater treatment systems. Hence, we compare maintained and unmaintained sensors to monitor the biological performance of a small-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The sensor types are ion-selective pH, optical dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) with platinum electrode. We created soft sensors using engineered features: ammonium valley for pH, oxidation ramp for DO, and nitrite ramp for the ORP. Four soft sensors based on unmaintained pH sensors correctly identified the completion of the ammonium oxidation (89–91 out of 107 cycles), about as many times as soft sensors based on a maintained pH sensor (91 out of 107 cycles). In contrast, the DO soft sensor using data from a maintained sensor showed slightly better (89 out of 96 cycles) detection performance than that using data from two unmaintained sensors (77, respectively 82 out of 96 correct). Furthermore, the DO soft sensor using maintained data is much less sensitive to the optimisation of cut-off frequency and slope tolerance than the soft sensor using unmaintained data. The nitrite ramp provided no useful information on the state of nitrite oxidation, so no comparison of maintained and unmaintained ORP sensors was possible in this case. We identified two hurdles when designing soft sensors for unmaintained sensors: i) Sensors’ type- and design-specific deterioration affects performance. ii) Feature engineering for soft sensors is sensor type specific, and the outcome is strongly influenced by operational parameters such as the aeration rate. In summary, the results with the provided soft sensors show that frequent sensor maintenance is not necessarily needed to monitor the performance of SBRs. Without sensor maintenance monitoring smalls-scale SBRs becomes practicable, which could improve the reliability of unstaffed on-site treatment systems substantially.},

  abstract = {Several methods to detect faults have been developed in various fields, mainly in chemical and process engineering. However, minimal practical guidelines exist for their selection and application. This work presents an index that allows for evaluating monitoring and diagnosis performance of fault detection methods, which takes into account several characteristics, such as false alarms, false acceptance, and undesirable switching from correct detection to non-detection during a fault event. The usefulness of the index to process engineering is demonstrated first by application to a simple example. Then, it is used to compare five univariate fault detection methods (Shewhart, EWMA, and residuals of EWMA) applied to the simulated results of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 long-term (BSM1\_LT). The BSM1\_LT, provided by the IWA Task Group on Benchmarking of Control Strategies, is a simulation platform that allows for creating sensor and actuator faults and process disturbances in a wastewater treatment plant. The results from the method comparison using BSM1\_LT show better performance to detect a sensor measurement shift for adaptive methods (residuals of EWMA) and when monitoring the actuator signals in a control loop (e.g., airflow). Overall, the proposed index is able to screen fault detection methods. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The framework for incorporating faults and failures is based on Markov chains and displays the appealing property of easy transition of sensor and actuator history into a model for fault generation. The paper briefly describes Markov theory and how this is used together with models for sensor and actuator dynamics to achieve a realistic simulation of measurements and actuators.},

In this work, we show that such assumptions are unrealistic, at least for sensors built around an ion-selective measurement principle. Indeed, long-term exposure of sensors to treated wastewater shows that sensors exhibit fault symptoms that appear simultaneously and with similar intensity. Consequently, this suggests that future research should be reoriented towards methods that do not rely on the assumptions mentioned above. This study also provides the first empirically validated sensor fault model for wastewater treatment simulation, which is useful for effective benchmarking of both fault detection and identification methods and advanced control strategies. Finally, we evaluate the value of redundancy for remote sensor validation in decentralized wastewater treatment systems.},

Therefore, the quality of sensor instantaneous measurements can be improved significantly if they are complemented with valuable information about the geometric features of their trajectories. The present paper describes the design and implementation of a Standard Signal Processing Architecture (SSPA) from which enriched sensor information is generated automatically. The SSPA has been made up of three complementary modules: the pre-processing module, the storage module and the post-processing module. Moreover, the SSPA has been parameterised so as to allow its adaptation to the specifications of every signal. By performing basic calculations on pre-processed signal trajectories, the storage module produces enriched vectors which collect information of the first and second time derivatives, average and variance values, peak values, linear regression parameters, curvature, etc. Then, the enriched information vectors can be exploited to implement customised monitoring and control tools. In this respect, the effectiveness of the SSPA has been demonstrated in three different practical cases: (1) OUR and KLa identification algorithms; (2) processing of measurements for real-time controllers; and, (3) detection of bend-points in on-line signals of SBR processes. © IWA Publishing 2008.},

The main purpose of using PCA is the dimensionality reduction by extraction of the feature space that still contain the most information in the original data set. Despite its success in this field, the most important obstacle faced is the sensitivity to noise, also the fact that the majority of collected data from industrial processes are normally contaminated by noise makes it unreliable in some cases. To overcome these limitations, several strategies have been used. One of these has been interested to combine the robustness theory with PCA method, such theory sonsists in robustifying the existing algorithms against noise or outliers. Fuzzy Robust Principal Components Analysis (FRPCA) is one of the result for such combination that acheive better result compared with the classical method. In this work the RFPCA method is used and compared with the classical one to monitoring a biological nitrogen removal process.

  abstract = {Hydroinformatics, as an interdisciplinary domain that blurs boundaries between water science, data science and computer science, is constantly evolving and reinventing itself. At the heart of this evolution, lies a continuous process of critical (self) appraisal of the discipline’s past, present and potential for further evolution, that creates a positive feedback loop between legacy, reality and aspirations. The power of this process is attested by the successful story of hydroinformatics thus far, which has arguably been able to mobilize wide ranging research and development and get the water sector more in tune with the digital revolution of the past 30 years. In this context, this paper attempts to trace the evolution of the discipline, from its computational hydraulics origins to its present focus on the complete socio-technical system, by providing at the same time, a functional framework to improve the understanding and highlight the links between different strands of the state-of-art hydroinformatic research and innovation. Building on this state-of-art landscape, the paper then attempts to provide an overview of key developments that are coming up, on the discipline’s horizon, focusing on developments relevant to urban water management, while at the same time, highlighting important legal, ethical and technical challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that the brightest aspects of this potential future are realized. Despite obvious limitations imposed by a single paper’s ability to report on such a diverse and dynamic field, it is hoped that this work contributes to a better understanding of both the current state of hydroinformatics and to a shared vision on the most exciting prospects for the future evolution of the discipline and the water sector it serves.},

There are two prominent modelling frameworks for IEM: component-based and service-oriented frameworks. The former one has been widely employed in local computer environments, and has its advantage in having concrete and community-wide tools. The latter one can take advantage of Web technologies for integrating distributed environmental models. However, the complex interaction between environmental models such as time marching models is still a challenge for integrating models on the Web. This paper suggests to take the best of both frameworks. Models are shared on the Web as WebSocket services. A hybrid approach to leverage OpenMI and WebSocket for coupling components and services is proposed to provide a flexible IEM environment. The result illustrates the applicability of the approach and demonstrates the advantage of WebSocket over the traditional HTTP approach in model execution.},

Still, as long as everything works fine, it is not noted but when things go wrong it will be observed. ICA has now about forty years of history in water and wastewater systems and is well recognized. One early attitude was that ICA will be a necessary burden to be added to a plant in order to correct for a poor design. However, the key reason for ICA is the fact that all processes are subject to disturbances, externally via the wastewater influent, from the customers in a water supply system, or from operations in one unit process that will propagate as a disturbance to another unit within a plant. This paper is an attempt to describe the development of ICA in water and wastewater systems. Most of it is based on personal experiences with all their limitations. No single paper can fairly describe the development that is documented in thousands of research papers, practiced by so many operators and process engineers and implemented in so many treatment systems. Still, the hope is that the paper can give a flavour of the most important ingredients of this fascinating development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Models are schematic representations of systems that are useful for analysis to support decision-making.

Characteristics of effective models are presented, along with how wastewater modelling is integrated into the wastewater project life cycle. The desirable characteristics of wastewater treatment modelling platforms are then reviewed. Current developments of note in wastewater treatment modelling practice include estimates of greenhouse gas emissions, incorporating uncertainty into wastewater modelling and design practice, more fundamental modelling of process chemistry, and improved understanding of the degradability of wastewater constituents in different environments. Areas requiring greater emphasis include increased use of metabolic modelling, characterisation of the hydrodynamics of suspended and biofilm biological treatment processes, and the integration of biofilm and suspended growth process modelling. Wastewater treatment models must also interface with water and wastewater management software packages. While wastewater treatment modelling will continue to advance and make important contributions to practice, it must be remembered that these are complex systems which exhibit counter-intuitive behaviour (results differ from initial expectations) and multiple dynamic steady-states which can abruptly transition from one to another. © IWA Publishing 2011.},

Among all the configurations examined (modules a-f), two and three aerators connected in parallel (modules d, e and f) were able to bring more oxygen into water than the others. An increase in liquid flow rate led to an enhancement of the oxygen transfer coefficients, but the improvement was reduced if the liquid flow rate was too high.

Alternatives analyzed included periodic cleaning and repair of damaged piping and equipment; optimum ferric salt dosing, use of in situ scaling coupons; and engineered struvite precipitation. The effectiveness and cost of each alternative was evaluated using a newly constructed dynamic process model and a net present worth analysis. Results indicate that nutrient recovery was a potential benefit at both facilities.

This contribution showcases a Python™ package that allows a streamlined work-flow and provides possibilities for data analysis, validation and gap filling, with as main goals to use as much of the data as possible and to fill gaps in the data with a known reliability. This provides a means towards more data use and a more sound calibration and validation, while significantly reducing time spent on data reconciliation.

  abstract = {Current efforts towards achieving better connectivity and increasing intelligence in functioning of industrial processes are guided by the Industrial Internet of Things paradigm and implicitly stimulate occurrence of data accumulation. In recent years, several researchers and industrial products have presented Historian application solutions for data accumulation. The large amounts of data that are gathered by these Historians remains mostly unused or used only for reporting purposes. So far, Historians have been focused on connectivity, data manipulation possibilities, and sometimes on low-cost solutions in order to gain higher applicability or to integrate multiple SCADA servers (e.g. Siemens–WinCC, Schneider Electric – Vijeo Citect, IGSS, Wonderware, InduSoft Web Studio, Inductive Automation – Ignition, etc.), etc. Both literature and industry are currently unable to identify a Historian solution that functions in fog and efficiently applies and is built upon Industry 4.0 ideas. The future is to conceive a proactive Historian that is able to, besides gathering data, identify dependencies and patterns for particular processes and elaborate strategies to increase performance in order to provide feedback through corrective action on the functional system. Using available solutions, determining patterns by the Historian operator in the context of big data is a tremendous effort. The motivation of this research is provided by the currently unoptimized and partly inefficient systems in the water industry that can benefit from cost reduction and quality indicator improvements through IIoT concepts related to data processing and process adjustments. As the first part of more complex research to obtain a proactive Historian, the current paper wishes to propose a reference architecture and to address the issue of data dependency analyses as part of pattern identification structures. The conceptual approach targets a highly customizable solution considering the variety of industrial processes, but it also underlines basic software modules as generally applicable for the same reason. To prove the efficiency of the obtained solution in the context of real industrial processes, and their corresponding monitoring and control solutions, the paper presents a test scenario in the water industry.},

Between the time when geolocalized specimens are taken, and the time the resulting data ends up in analysis published within a study, many manual operations take place that are prone to generate errors. The French nodes of the European Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research Infrastructure called ”Zones Ateliers” propose a solution as generic as possible to this problem of monitoring of the samples and the data associated with them. Compared to existing solutions such as Laboratory Information Management Systems, we target a robust solution for labelling adapted to outdoor working conditions, with the management of storages and movements of samples. We designed and realized a software package tested from end to end, using open source licenses and cheap hardware, including small printers (mobile or not) and Raspberry Pis. This system provides sufficient flexibility so that it can facilitate working with a wide variety of existing protocols. One of the most interesting feature consists to record all contextual data associated with the samples, which constitute important parameters of the subsequent analyses. Furthermore, not only traceability is thus guaranteed, but also we can expect a reduced handling times and an increased streamlining of the storage of samples that will improve the return on investment.},

The first step of this method is to build a multi-way PCA (MPCA) model using the historical process data. In the second step, the principal scores and the Q-statistics resulting from the MPCA model are fed to the LAMDA clustering algorithm. This procedure is iterated twice. The first iteration provides an efficient and effective discrimination between normal and abnormal operational conditions. The second iteration of the procedure allowed a clear-cut discrimination of applied operational changes in the SBR history. Important to add is that this procedure helped identifying some changes in the process behaviour, which would not have been possible, had we only relied on visually inspecting this online data set of the SBR (which is traditionally the case in practice). Hence the PCA based clustering methodology is a promising tool to efficiently interpret and analyse the SBR process behaviour using large historical online data sets. © IWA Publishing 2008.},

While all these explanations are important, the last seems best able to explain our findings.},

Trend analysis was applied for the prediction of significant turbidity events ({$>$}99th percentile of data distribution). Artificial neural networks using antecedent moisture conditions as input parameters (all turbidity peaks) served to forecast daily turbidity time series. Results show that trend analyses help anticipate the timing of turbidity peaks ― with differences between the cold season (fall and winter) and the warm season (spring and summer) and mean anticipations between 45 and 85~min and 25 and 45~min, respectively ― and the magnitude of the peak. The artificial neural network model was developed and proven capable of predicting the mean levels of turbidity at the drinking water intake of the investigated catchment. These early warning systems could be applied to source water system forecasting and provide a framework for adjusting drinking water treatment operations.},

Optimization of wave break forest is also a new concept on wave attenuation studies.

Physical experiments were designed with considering the effects of different planting configurations on wave attenuation in three scenarios: (1) the equilateral triangle arrangement with different row spacings; (2) different arrangements with the same density; (3) different tree shapes with the same row spacing. The physical experiment condition was typically defined according to the field research of the study area. Then, a multiobjective weighting model for wave break forest design optimization was based on the scheme set of physical experiment outputs using the proposed CDUFW model. Physical experiments showed that different arrangement modes take advantage of the wave attenuation effect of different forest widths. The CDUFW model performed well in finding the effective, economic and reasonable scheme. The proposed model is excellent in data mining and classification, and can be applied to many decision-making and evaluation fields.},

The EU-funded TELEMAC project aims at improving the reliability and efficiency of monitoring and control of this type of wastewater treatment plant. One of its special features is the idea of a telecontrol centre which monitors multiple, geographically distributed plants remotely, acts as a centre of expertise, and brings together the expertise of a network of remote experts. Data mining has been identified as a potentially useful contributing technology. Sensor data is now becoming available for some pilot, laboratory scale, and industrial sized digesters. This paper presents the directions of work and emerging results of data mining.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

A data-driven optimal strategy without the prerequisite of expensive instruments and skilled engineers is thus attractive in practice. In this study, a data mining system was implemented to optimize the process design and operation in WWTPs in China, following an integral procedure including data collection and cleaning, data warehouse, data mining, and web user interface. A data warehouse was demonstrated and analyzed using one-year process data in 30 WWTPs in China. Six sludge removal loading rates on water quality indices, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP), were calculated as derived parameters and organized into fact sheets. A searching algorithm was programmed to find out the five records most similar to the target scenario. A web interface was developed for users to input scenarios, view outputs, and update the database. Two case WWTPs were investigated to verify the data mining system. The results indicated that effluent quality of Case-1 WWTP was improved to meet the discharging criteria through optimal operations, and the process design of Case-2 WWTP could be refined in a feedback loop. A discussion on the gaps, potential, and challenges of data mining in practice was provided. The data mining system in this study is a good candidate for engineers to understand and control their processes in WWTPs.},

  abstract = {Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes can significantly increase the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operations. Recent onsite measurement of N2O emissions at WWTPs have been used as an alternative to the controversial theoretical methods for the N2O calculation. The full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns help to expand our knowledge on the N2O production pathways and the triggering operational conditions of processes. The accurate N2O monitoring could help to find better process control solutions to mitigate N2O emissions of wastewater treatment systems. However, quantifying the emissions and understanding the long-term behaviour of N2O fluxes in WWTPs remains challenging and costly. A review of the recent full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns is conducted. The analysis covers the quantification and mitigation of emissions for different process groups, focusing on techniques that have been applied for the identification of dominant N2O pathways and triggering operational conditions, techniques using operational data and N2O data to identify mitigation measures and mechanistic modelling. The analysis of various studies showed that there are still difficulties in the comparison of N2O emissions and the development of emission factor (EF) databases; the N2O fluxes reported in literature vary significantly even among groups of similar processes. The results indicated that the duration of the monitoring campaigns can impact the EF range. Most N2O monitoring campaigns lasting less than one month, have reported N2O EFs less than 0.3\% of the N-load, whereas studies lasting over a year have a median EF equal to 1.7\% of the N-load. The findings of the current study indicate that complex feature extraction and multivariate data mining methods can efficiently convert wastewater operational and N2O data into information, determine complex relationships within the available datasets and boost the long-term understanding of the N2O fluxes behaviour. The acquisition of reliable full-scale N2O monitoring data is significant for the calibration and validation of the mechanistic models -describing the N2O emission generation in WWTPs. They can be combined with the multivariate tools to further enhance the interpretation of the complicated full-scale N2O emission patterns. Finally, a gap between the identification of effective N2O mitigation strategies and their actual implementation within the monitoring and control of WWTPs has been identified. This study concludes that there is a further need for i) long-term N2O monitoring studies, ii) development of data-driven methodological approaches for the analysis of WWTP operational and N2O data, and iii) better understanding of the trade-offs among N2O emissions, energy consumption and system performance to support the optimization of the WWTPs operation.},

Time-consuming and expensive local sampling and monitoring campaigns are usually carried out to estimate the characteristic flow and pollutant concentrations of CSO water. This study focuses on estimating the frequency and duration of wet-weather events and their impacts on influent flow and wastewater characteristics of the largest Italian wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Castiglione Torinese. Eight years (viz. 2009–2016) of historical data in addition to arithmetic mean daily precipitation rates (P I ) of the plant catchment area are elaborated. Relationships between P I and volumetric influent flow rate (Q in ), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium (N-NH 4 ), and total suspended solids (TSS) are investigated. A time series data mining (TSDM) method is implemented with MATLAB computing package for segmentation of time series by use of a sliding window algorithm (SWA) to partition the available records associated with wet and dry weather events. According to the TSDM results, a case-specific wet-weather definition is proposed for the Castiglione Torinese WWTP. Two significant weather-based influent scenarios are assessed by kernel density estimation. The results confirm that the method suggested within this study based on plant routinely collected data can be used for planning the emergency response and long-term preparedness for extreme climate conditions in a WWTP. Implementing the obtained results in dynamic process simulation models can improve the plant operational efficiency in managing the fluctuating loads.},

BOD is a parameter describing the quality of water, especially its extent of pollution. Water from wastewater treatment plants have high BOD values and as such require to be treated. For this purpose, BOD is used as an indicator in determining the quality of water being discharged. The standard method for measuring BOD is a 5-day process. Dilution of sample, constant pH and nutrient content besides temperature of 20°C and dark area are required for correct results. High levels of nitrogen compounds yield false BOD results. Winkler titration, which is also used to measure DO (as part of BOD measurement), is a chemical-intensive process. Hence an automatic prediction model for BOD is required for accurate, cost-effective and time-saving measurement. Based on data available for BOD measurements, the present study focuses on devising a prediction model for BOD using ensemble techniques in data mining. A correlation coefficient of 0.9541 and a root mean-squared error of 0.4679 were obtained for the proposed BOD prediction model on river water quality data. Comparative analysis of the proposed model with existing models built for the same data set was also performed.},

In literature, the focus has primarily been on impacts of singular climate changes, such as the impact of more intense storm events in summer or prolonged wet periods in winter. The impact of these expected climate changes on wastewater system performance has been studied extensively by applying the expected climate change as input for urban drainage, sewer or wastewater treatment models. The model-based analysis of the impact of climate change has an important drawback: applied models can only represent the processes incorporated in the model and typically have a limited universality, if at all calibrated, due to the limited information available in the time series used for model calibration. Literature describing possible climate change impacts on performance of the urban wastewater infrastructure based on the analysis of monitoring data is hardly available.Recent developments in continuous monitoring have resulted in an increased availability of high quality data sets. These data sets allow assessment of the impacts of climate change by scrutinizing the data sets searching for meteorological conditions that resemble expected climate changes. The potential of applying data analysis to study climate change effects is illustrated for the case of the Eindhoven wastewater system, for which an extensive database is available. The results of this study show that, due to the limitations of state of the art sewer water quality models as well as WWTP models, model based assessment of climate change impacts does not properly address all possible impacts of climate change. Consequently, the impact of climate change is underestimated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Some of the basic concepts of modeling with emphasis on the relationship of these to engineering research and practice are then presented, these being (1) differences in the use of, and expectations from, models by researchers and practitioners, (2) sources of information useful for model development, (3) the amount and type of testing needed for model validation, and (4) the required accuracy of models. Computer simulation is necessary for the solution of most dynamic models. Recent advances in both hardware and software for personal computers have resulted in inexpensive, user-friendly systems suitable for use in both large and small organizations as well as by individual engineers.},

  abstract = {Low-cost aerators relying on the venturi principle to entrain air into flowing water have the notable advantage of contributing both to water mixing and oxygen transfer, making them attractive for wastewater treatment in low-resource settings. This study aimed to characterize the performance of such aerators by describing the impact of different design characteristics, including water flow rate, the number of nozzles used, and the nozzle depth. The study also explored the effect on aeration performance of temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration, and addition of the archetypal surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Tests were conducted in a 200 L reactor with 2, 3 or 4 nozzles, at depths of 20, 40 or 60 cm, while circulating water through the aeration device at a rate of 400, 600 or 800 L/h. The configuration that yielded the highest mass transfer coefficient (KLa20 of 20.8 h-1) had both the highest flow rate (800 L/h) and the smallest number of nozzles (2). Nozzle depth had no detectable effect on performance. The configuration with the highest standard aeration efficiency (SAE) had a low flow rate (400 L/h) and 4 nozzles. The effect of TDS concentration was not detected in the concentration range typical of domestic wastewater (300–1 250 mg/L). The effect of temperature on KLa followed a first-order exponential curve, as reported in the literature (θ = 1.02). Addition of SDS was found to increase the KLa20 of the tested aerator design by up to 60\% of its value in tap water, in contrast to results from literature. The performance data obtained herein was compared to other types of aerators. Though venturi nozzles were found to be less efficient than other available technologies, it is proposed that using plunging rather than immersed venturi nozzles could increase performance to an attractive level for low-resource applications.},

  abstract = {The aim of this contribution is partly to build consensus on a consistent modelling methodology (CMM) of complex real processes in wastewater treatment by combining classical concepts with results from applied mathematics, and partly to apply it to the clarification-thickening process in the secondary settling tank. In the CMM, the real process should be approximated by a mathematical model (process model; ordinary or partial differential equation (ODE or PDE)), which in turn is approximated by a simulation model (numerical method) implemented on a computer. These steps have often not been carried out in a correct way. The secondary settling tank was chosen as a case since this is one of the most complex processes in a wastewater treatment plant and simulation models developed decades ago have no guarantee of satisfying fundamental mathematical and physical properties. Nevertheless, such methods are still used in commercial tools to date. This particularly becomes of interest as the state-of-the-art practice is moving towards plant-wide modelling. Then all submodels interact and errors propagate through the model and severely hamper any calibration effort and, hence, the predictive purpose of the model. The CMM is described by applying it first to a simple conversion process in the biological reactor yielding an ODE solver, and then to the solid–liquid separation in the secondary settling tank, yielding a PDE solver. Time has come to incorporate established mathematical techniques into environmental engineering, and wastewater treatment modelling in particular, and to use proven reliable and consistent simulation models.},

Based on the solids flux concept and on a mass balance around each layer of a one-dimensional settler, this model can simulate the solids profile throughout the settling column, including the underflow and effluent suspended solids concentrations under steady-state and dynamic conditions. The model makes use of a special settling velocity equation designed to simulate the settling velocity of dilute and more concentrated suspensions. The model can be applied to both primary and secondary settlers to simulate dynamic and steady-state conditions. Examples based on full-scale and pilot-scale experimental data taken from the literature serve to illustrate the application of the model to secondary settlers.

Understanding how water quality responds to these forces can help to guide future efforts to maintain water security and sustainability. We here analyzed the nationwide variability of inland water quality across China from 2003 to 2017 and its responses to anthropogenic discharges. We show that water quality has been improved markedly or was maintained at favorable levels over the country because of reduced discharges in the industrial, rural, and urban residential sectors. However, growing discharges from the agricultural sector threaten these gains. Moreover, the present status of water pollution is relatively severe in north and northeast China. Our findings suggest that China's water quality would further benefit from more flexible strategies for mitigation measures, which respond to regional differences in the factors that influence water pollution levels in specific regions.},

Here we develop and test systematic methods to quantify progress towards the 17 SDGs at national and subnational levels in China. Our analyses indicate that China’s SDG Index score (an aggregate score representing the overall performance towards achieving all 17 SDGs) increased at the national level from 2000 to 2015. Every province also increased its SDG Index score over this period. There were large spatio-temporal variations across regions. For example, eastern China had a higher SDG Index score than western China in the 2000s, and southern China had a higher SDG Index score than northern China in 2015. At the national level, the scores of 13 of the 17 SDGs improved over time, but the scores of four SDGs declined. This study suggests the need to track the spatio-temporal dynamics of progress towards SDGs at the global level and in other nations.},

The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management.},

Each hybrid model consists of a set of non linear differential equations and a neural model. The set of differential equations attempts to describe as much as possible the phenomenology of the process whereas neural networks model predict some key parameters that are an essential part of the phenomenological model. The neural model is obtained indirectly, that is, using the prediction errors of one or more state variables to adjust its weights instead of successive presentations of input-output data of the neural network. This approach allows to use actual measurements to derive a suitable neural model that not only represents the variation of some key parameters but it is also able to partly include dynamic behaviour unaccounted for by the phenomenological model. The approach is described in detail using three test cases: (1) the fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid by the micro-organism Pseudomonas ovalis, (2) the growth of filamentous fungi in a solid state fermenter, and (3) the propagation of filamentous fungi growing on a 2-D solid substrate. Results for the three applications clearly demonstrate that using a hybrid model is a viable alternative for modelling complex biotechnological bioprocesses.},

  abstract = {Detecting wastewater toxicity in due time is essential for protection of a sewage works and the receiving waters. A respirometric method is presented that performs short batch experiments, so-called In-Sensor-Experiments for toxicity detection. Two types of wastewater samples can be added to the reactor in the device: either the potentially toxic wastewater entering the plant, or, a defined mixture of acetate and ammonia. From the latter experiments models are identified that describe the heterotrophic and autotrophic activity of the sludge. Since these 'calibration' experiments are alternated with experiments in which wastewater is injected, the effect of the wastewater on the sludge can be quantified unequivocally. Full-scale toxicity detection (and the corresponding effluent quality) results are reported for a plant treating a mixture of hospital and municipal wastewaters. The respirometer was installed at the influent line of the plant. It was evaluated during a 6-month period for its on-line toxicity detection capacity. Both deliberate and accidental intoxications were recorded and compared with off-line toxicity measurements. Inhibitory wastewaters affected the nitrification activity of the sludge. This was confirmed by the concomitant increase in NH4+discharge of the treatment plant. To evaluate the efficiency of control actions, the deliberate addition of toxicant was interrupted at the time a toxicity alarm was triggered by the respirometer. It was observed that plant performance then remained unaffected for all monitored criteria.},

The resulting aeration of the jet affected its expansion, its shape, the air entrainment rate, the bubble penetration depth, and hence the oxygen transfer efficiency.

The Laboratory is a mobile facility housing instrumentation for on-line respirometry and sensors for real-time monitoring of sludge blanket level and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, ammonium-N, nitrite-N, total oxidised nitrogen, total organic carbon and orthophosphate-P concentrations. The Laboratory has been designed for deployment in a variety of contexts, but principally in the study of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, protection of surface water quality, aquaculture, and groundwater contamination. Its purpose is to support the development of process models and, where appropriate, procedures of decision support and automatic control for these systems. Preliminary results from commissioning trials with the Laboratory at the Athens, Georgia, Water Pollution Control Facility Number 2 are reported.

  abstract = {A short review of different respirometric methods is presented, and advantages and disadvantages of different principles are discussed. In this study a combined respirometric-titrimetric set-up was applied to monitor the degradation processes during batch experiments with activated sludge. The respirometer consists of an open aerated vessel and a closed non-aerated respiration chamber. It is operated with two oxygen probes resulting in two sources of information on the oxygen uptake rate; both collected at a high frequency. The respirometer is combined with a titrimetric unit that keeps the pH of the activated sludge sample at a constant value through the addition of acid and/or base. The cumulative amount of added acid and base serves as a complementary information source on the degradation processes. Interpretation of respirometric data resulting from validation experiments (additions of acetate and urea as ammonium source) showed that the set-up provided reliable data. Data interpretation was approached in two ways: (1) via a basic calculation procedure, in which the oxygen uptake rates were obtained by an oxygen mass balance over the respiration chamber, and (2) via a model-based procedure in which substrate transport was included for a more accurate data interpretation. Simulation examples showed that the presence of substrate transport in the model may be crucial for a correct data interpretation, since experimental conditions (e.g. low flow rate) and/or the biodegradation kinetic parameters (e.g. high KS) may otherwise lead to data interpretation errors. Earlier studies already pointed out that titrimetric data can be related to nitrification, and this was also confirmed in this study. However, in addition, it was shown here for experiments with acetate that the amount of acid dosed was clearly related to the amount of acetate degraded. This indicates that the titrimetric data can be used to study the carbon source degradation. For the titrimetric data in this study, a model-based analysis was however only applied for the nitrification process. For an experiment with ammonium, it was illustrated that the estimation of biodegradation kinetics on a combined respirometric-titrimetric data set significantly improves confidence intervals of the parameters compared to the parameter estimation based on respirometric or titrimetric data separately.

Froth depth, collection zone gas hold-up and bias rate are selected as secondary variables to be controlled whereas tailing, wash-water and gas flow rate are used as manipulated variables. The control problem was formulated in order to minimize the tracking error of the gas hold-up and bias rate by maintaining gas flow rate, wash-water flow rate and bias rate within their operational limits. In particular, a strategy was conceived to optimize the column flotation process based on establishing an unreachable high set point for the gas hold-up (which is equivalent to maximizing the bubble surface area available for particle collection at a given flotation reagent dosage and thus recovery), while simultaneously satisfying operational constraints (such as ensuring a positive bias rate to prevent gangue entrainment and therefore concentrate grade deterioration). Several other operational constraints on wash-water, gas rate, gas hold-up and bias rate were considered, their use being justified from a processing point of view. Since this study deals with the hydrodynamic characteristics of flotation columns, a pilot flotation column working with a two-phase system is sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of using predictive control for this process optimization. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For this study, two structures are used for experimental assessment: a steel sheet and a turbine blade of an aircraft. The analysis has been performed in two ways: (i) by exciting the structure with low-frequency vibrations using a shaker and using several piezoelectric (PZT) sensors attached on the surface, and (ii) by exciting at high-frequency vibrations using a single PZT as actuator and several PZTs as sensors. A known vibration signal is applied and the dynamical responses are analyzed. A PCA model is built using data from the undamaged structure as a reference base line. The defects in the turbine blade are simulated by attaching a mass on the surface at different positions. Instead, a progressive crack is produced to the steel sheet. Data from sets of experiments for undamaged and damaged scenarios are projected into the PCA model. The first two projections, and the Q-statistic and T2-statistic indices are analyzed. Q-statistic indicates how well each sample conforms to the PCA model. It is a measure of the difference or residual between a sample and its projection into the principal components retained in the model. T2-statistic index is a measure of the variation of each sample within the PCA model. Results of each scenario are presented and discussed demonstrating the feasibility and potential of using this formulation in structural health monitoring. © The Author(s) 2010.},

Implementation of continuous water quality measurement systems is allowing to capture the dynamics in water systems for identification of critical events, cause-effect relationships and trends among others. Huge amounts of data are then being generated with uncertain quality. Water quality monitoring networks will only be useful in practice if careful quality assessment, of the data is carried out. With a practical vision, this paper presents a method for automatic data quality assessment extracting information from individual water quality time series from on-line sensors. Data mining techniques based on forecasting models are used to detect and remove unreliable data from the raw data sets. A posterior analysis is applied to remove noise and detect abnormal situations and potential sensor faults. The proposed tool has been successfully tested on water quality time series collected from different water and wastewater systems.},

Once all production units that generate wastewater and the diverse wastewater treatment systems are specified, the model automatically identifies the best treatment option for each water stream: reuse or recycle with or without regeneration. The formulated optimisation problem is solved using mathematical programming techniques and details about the optimum treatment for each stream are obtained.

The hybrid model combines a partial first principles model, which incorporates the available prior knowledge about the process being modeled, with a neural network which serves as an estimator of unmeasured process parameters that are difficult to model from first principles. This hybrid model has better properties than standard ?black-box? neural network models in that it is able to interpolate and extrapolate much more accurately, is easier to analyze and interpret, and requires significantly fewer training examples. Two alternative state and parameter estimation strategies, extended Kalman filtering and NLP optimization, are also considered. When no a priori known model of the unobserved process parameters is available, the hybrid network model gives better estimates of the parameters, when compared to these methods. By providing a model of these unmeasured parameters, the hybrid network can also make predictions and hence can be used for process optimization. These results apply both when full and partial state measurements are available, but in the latter case a state reconstruction method must be used for the first principles component of the hybrid model.},

In recent years, neural network and hybrid neural networks have been much studied especially for modeling of nonlinear system. It has however been applied mainly as an estimator in parts of various control systems and the idea of utilizing it directly as a neural-controller has not been studied. Hence the contribution of this work is to use an inverse neural network in hybrid with a first principle model for the direct control of a nonlinear semi-batch polymerization process. These hybrid models were utilized in the direct inverse control strategy to track the set point of the temperature of the polymerization reactor under nominal condition and with various disturbances. For comparison purposes, the standard neural network and proportional-integral-derivative controller were also implemented in these control strategies. Adaptation mechanisms to improve the results have also been carried out to test the capability of these hybrid methods in control.

Using 27 out of 1 100 data points is evidently not a sound means of evaluating the overall accuracy of the proposed equation.

  abstract = {The minimum velocity required to prevent sediment deposition in open channels is examined in this study. The parameters affecting transport are first determined and then categorized into different dimensionless groups, including “movement,” “transport,” “sediment,” “transport mode,” and “flow resistance.” Six different models are presented to identify the effect of each of these parameters. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is used to predict the densimetric Froude number (Fr) and the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is utilized to train it. The results of this algorithm are compared with back propagation (BP), genetic programming (GP) and existing sediment transport equations. The results indicate that FFNN-ELM produced better results than FNN-BP, GP and existing sediment transport methods in both training (RMSE~=~0.26 and MARE~=~0.052) and testing (RMSE~=~0.121 and MARE~=~0.023). Moreover, the performance of FFNN-ELM is examined for different pipe diameters.},

In particular, it is widely recognized that ELM has speed advantage while performing satisfying results. However, the presence of outliers may give rise to unreliable ELM model. In this paper, our study addresses the outlier robustness of ELM in regression problems. Based on the sparsity characteristic of outliers, this work proposes an outlier-robust ELM where the ℓ1-norm loss function is used to enhance the robustness. Specially, the fast and accurate augmented Lagrangian multiplier method is applied to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency. According to the experiments on function approximation and some real-world applications, the proposed approach not only maintains the advantages from original ELM, but also shows notable and stable accuracy in handling data with outliers.},

  abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For the preliminary idea of the ELM algorithm, refer to "Extreme Learning Machine: A New Learning Scheme of Feedforward Neural Networks", Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25-29 July, 2004. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R.

First, a reduced nonlinear model is presented, which is based on expression for nitrification reaction rate in activated sludge model No. 1 and modified for attached biomass processes, while second, a linear black-box model is shown. The data used for model identification were collected during several weeks of experiments on a real plant so that good identification data were obtained. The designed models were validated based on open loop simulations and predictions. Validation results show that the reduced nonlinear model performs better compared to the linear model, however, both models show relatively large errors compared to the real plant data. Hence, a closed loop simulation study was performed to see the differences between the performance of model predictive controller using previously estimated linear and nonlinear models and a standard proportional integral (PI) controller. From the simulation study results it was seen that in spite of relatively large model errors the MPC algorithms give better results in terms of ammonia removal compared to the PI controller, while MPC with the nonlinear model shows additional improvements over the MPC with the linear model. © 2006 ISA - The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society.},

For discrete-time bilinear systems, a quadratic cost on the predicted outputs and inputs, together with input/state constraints, results in a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem.

However, conventionally obtained calibration data sets are often not exhaustive and have significant drawbacks. In the Graz West catchment area (Graz, Austria), continuous high-resolution long-term online measurements for discharge and pollutant concentration have been carried out since 2002. In this paper, the application of single- and multi-objective auto-calibration schemes based on evolution strategies for a deterministic hydrological pollutant load model will be discussed. Three approaches for pollutant load modelling are examined and compared: using a constant storm weather concentration and two surface accumulation-wash-off approaches with basic respectively extended wash-off equations. It is shown that the applied auto-calibration method leads to very satisfying results for both the calibration and the validation data set, and also for the dry and the storm weather runoff. Results from multi-objective calibration show better robustness in validation events than single-objective calibration. The build-up wash-off approach using the basic wash-off equation gives the best correlations between measured data and simulation results. © IWA Publishing 2009.},

The novelty is the experimental setup for installation of temperature sensors in CSO structures and an algorithm developed to automatically calculate the duration of CSO events considering the response time of the system. The occurrence and duration of CSO events is computed based on the convergence of the two temperature signals. The method was tested under field conditions in a CSO structure, and the results were compared to the information gathered from a parallel installed flow sensor. The application of two temperature sensors installed inside a CSO structure was proven to be robust and accurate for the automatic detection of the occurrence and duration of CSO events. Within the 7-month test phase, 100\% of the 20 CSO events could be detected without false detections. The accuracy of detecting the start and end of the CSO events was 2 min in comparison to the flow sensor.},

In this work, we employed Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometer to determine organic compounds concentration along different heights of anaerobic filter and 16SrRNA high-throughput gene sequencing analysis to reveal microbial community distribution. As results, 360 genera were detected in the reactor, where Acrpbacter, Proteiniphilum, Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Sedimentibacter, Enterobacter and Dysgonomonas dominated the microbiological community. They were found to have obvious correlations with the degradation of some bio-refractory compounds including phenol, methylphenol, dimethylphenol, naphthol, triphenylene and indole in coking wastewater. Specially, phenol degradation has a high coefficient with Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Sedimentibacter. Methylphenol degradation exhibits the good relativity with Enterobacter and Sedimentibacter. Besides the well-known Enterobacter, Dysgonomonas, Pseudomonas and Comamonas for phenol and methylphenol degradation, most importantly, we found the high correlation coefficients of Sedimentibacter to phenol, methylphenol, dimethylphenol and naphthol degradation. The new finding would be benefit for the identification of Sedimentibacter for phenol, methylphenol, dimethylphenol and naphthol degradation, and the isolation of related bacteria for bio-augmentation. This study is useful to reveal “black box” model of coking wastewater biological treatment and provides another way to investigate functional bacteria to degrade bio-refractory compounds.},

  abstract = {When treating municipal wastewater, the disposal of sludge is a problem of growing importance, representing up to 50\% of the current operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant. Although different disposal routes are possible, anaerobic digestion plays an important role for its abilities to further transform organic matter into biogas (60-70 vol\% of methane, CH4), as thereby it also reduces the amount of final sludge solids for disposal whilst destroying most of the pathogens present in the sludge and limiting odour problems associated with residual putrescible matter. Anaerobic digestion thus optimises WWTP costs, its environmental footprint and is considered a major and essential part of a modern WWTP. The potential of using the biogas as energy source has long been widely recognised and current techniques are being developed to upgrade quality and to enhance energy use. The present paper extensively reviews the principles of anaerobic digestion, the process parameters and their interaction, the design methods, the biogas utilisation, the possible problems and potential pro-active cures, and the recent developments to reduce the impact of the problems. After having reviewed the basic principles and techniques of the anaerobic digestion process, modelling concepts will be assessed to delineate the dominant parameters. Hydrolysis is recognised as rate-limiting step in the complex digestion process. The microbiology of anaerobic digestion is complex and delicate, involving several bacterial groups, each of them having their own optimum working conditions. As will be shown, these groups are sensitive to and possibly inhibited by several process parameters such as pH, alkalinity, concentration of free ammonia, hydrogen, sodium, potassium, heavy metals, volatile fatty acids and others. To accelerate the digestion and enhance the production of biogas, various pre-treatments can be used to improve the rate-limiting hydrolysis. These treatments include mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological interventions to the feedstock. All pre-treatments result in a lysis or disintegration of sludge cells, thus releasing and solubilising intracellular material into the water phase and transforming refractory organic material into biodegradable species. Possible techniques to upgrade the biogas formed by removing CO2, H2S and excess moisture will be summarised. Special attention will be paid to the problems associated with siloxanes (SX) possibly present in the sludge and biogas, together with the techniques to either reduce their concentration in sludge by preventive actions such as peroxidation, or eliminate the SX from the biogas by adsorption or other techniques. The reader will finally be guided to extensive publications concerning the operation, control, maintenance and troubleshooting of anaerobic digestion plants. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Rising expectations concerning levels of service, protection of the environment and enhanced sustainability are putting increasing demands on the urban wastewater system. The conventional approach to design and operation of the system, considering each component separately, cannot provide the gains in performance required. However, with recent gains in the understanding and modeling of the system it is now possible to represent the system as a whole and to optimize its performance. This paper describes the development and benefits of integrated modelling of the operation and control of urban wastewater systems and describes the development of a simulation package SYNOPSIS. SYNOPSIS encompasses sub-models of the sewer system, treatment plant and river, based on commonly accepted modeling approaches. The sub-models are linked in a parallel way allowing interactions between these sub-systems to be fully considered. This feature, used in concert with a control module implemented in the software, proves to be of particular importance for the development and analysis of integrated real-time control strategies. The model is applied to a case study site where it is clearly shown that river quality can be significantly improved by implementing an integrated control strategy as compared with the conventional passive or local control scenario. It is also shown how the application of conventional criteria (e.g. overflow volumes, discharged pollutant loads) can result in misleading conclusions when assessing the performance of the urban wastewater system under various scenarios. The paper argues that it is no longer necessary to use such simplified criteria, but using the software and techniques outlined, it is now feasible to operate complete urban wastewater systems to maximize river water quality directly. Furthermore, simulation results indicate the clear potential of integrated control even for catchments where local control provides hardly any benefits. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The use of artificial neural network (ANN) models in water resources applications has grown considerably over the last decade. However, an important step in the ANN modelling methodology that has received little attention is the selection of appropriate model inputs. This article is the first in a two-part series published in this issue and addresses the lack of a suitable input determination methodology for ANN models in water resources applications. The current state of input determination is reviewed and two input determination methodologies are presented. The first method is a model-free approach, which utilises a measure of the mutual information criterion to characterise the dependence between a potential model input and the output variable. To facilitate the calculation of dependence in the case of multiple inputs, a partial measure of the mutual information criterion is used. In the second method, a self-organizing map (SOM) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and obtain independent inputs. To determine which inputs have a significant relationship with the output (dependent) variable, a hybrid genetic algorithm and general regression neural network (GAGRNN) is used. Both input determination techniques are tested on a number of synthetic data sets, where the dependence attributes were known a priori. In the second paper of the series, the input determination methodology is applied to a real-world case study in order to determine suitable model inputs for forecasting salinity in the River Murray, South Australia, 14 days in advance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting Benchmark Simulation Model No 1 (BSM1) has been the basis for a significant new development that is reported on here: Rather than only evaluating control strategies at the level of the activated sludge unit (bioreactors and secondary clarifier) the new BSM2 now allows the evaluation of control strategies at the level of the whole plant, including primary clarifier and sludge treatment with anaerobic sludge digestion. In this contribution, the decisions that have been made over the past three years regarding the models used within the BSM2 are presented and argued, with particular emphasis on the ADM1 description of the digester, the interfaces between activated sludge and digester models, the included temperature dependencies and the reject water storage. BSM2-implementations are now available in a wide range of simulation platforms and a ring test has verified their proper implementation, consistent with the BSM2 definition. This guarantees that users can focus on the control strategy evaluation rather than on modelling issues. Finally, for illustration, twelve simple operational strategies have been implemented in BSM2 and their performance evaluated. Results show that it is an interesting control engineering challenge to further improve the performance of the BSM2 plant (which is the whole idea behind benchmarking) and that integrated control (i.e. acting at different places in the whole plant) is certainly worthwhile to achieve overall improvement. © IWA Publishing 2007.},

In this paper, a self-organizing radial basis function (RBF) neural network model predictive control (SORBF-MPC) method is proposed for controlling the DO concentration in a WWTP. The proposed SORBF can vary its structure dynamically to maintain prediction accuracy. The hidden nodes in the RBF neural network can be added or removed on-line based on node activity and mutual information (MI) to achieve the appropriate network complexity and the necessary dynamism. Moreover, the convergence of the SORBF is analyzed in both the dynamic process phase and the phase following the modification of the structure. Finally, the SORBF-MPC is applied to the Benchmark Simulation Model 1 (BSM1) WWTP to maintain the DO concentration. The results show that SORBF-MPC effectively provides process control. The performance comparison also indicates that the proposed model's predictive control strategy yields the most accurate for DO concentration, better effluent qualities, and lower average aeration energy (AE) consumption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The control strategies differ in the information used about the process (number of sensors and sensor location) and in the complexity of the control algorithms. To determine the set-points that yield optimal operating costs, an operational map is constructed for each control strategy. Results of the simulation show that with PI and feedforward controllers almost the same optimal operating costs can be achieved as with more advanced MPC algorithms under various plant operating conditions.

Fine-pore diffusers are today almost ubiquitous in municipal wastewater aeration, due to their advantageous aeration efficiency (mass of oxygen transferred per unit energy required). Nevertheless, older municipal treatment facilities and many industrial treatment plants are still equipped with coarse-bubble or surface aerators. Fine-pore diffusers are subject to two major disadvantages: a) fouling, if not cleaned periodically; b) decrease in oxygen transfer efficiency caused by dissolved surfactants. Coarse-bubble and surface aerators are typically not subject to the traditional problems affecting fine-pore diffusers. Nonetheless, they achieve oxygen transfer at the expense of increased energy intensity. The increased biomass concentration associated with high mean cell retention time (MCRT) operations has a beneficial effect on aeration. Nutrient-removing selectors are able to further increase aeration efficiency, as they sorb and utilize the readily available substrate which otherwise would accumulate at bubble surfaces and dramatically decrease aeration efficiency. We summarise here our 30-year long experience in aeration research, and results obtained with clean- and process-water tests are used to show the beneficial effects of high MCRT operations, the beneficial effect of selectors, and the decline of aeration efficiency due to dissolved surfactants. © IWA Publishing 2008.},

  institution = {Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindoven, The Netherlands},
  abstract = {Stricter legislation on nutrient removal in wastewater treatment requires improved performance of activated sludge processes. The aim of this thesis is to study possible performance improvements of activated sludge plants for nitrogen removal through application of advanced modelling and control techniques and to develop methodologies to achieve improved operation. The emphasis is on continuously operated carrousel systems and pre-denitrification plants, which are the most important systems in The Netherlands. Different topics are addressed along successive steps in control system design, namely definition of the control goal, plant modelling and identification and controller design. An inventory of the literature reveals that insufficient insight exists in the relationship between legislation and control goals. Artificial, indirect and vague control goals are applied that lead to time-consuming trial-and-error design procedures and that complicate judgement of particular controller designs. The availability of advanced modelling and control techniques argues to develop straightforward, optimisation-based controller design procedures to close the gap between legislation and controller specifications. Such a so-called analytic design procedure is characterised by mathematical modelling of goals, disturbances and plant and application of mathematical optimisation, where qualitative goals for activated sludge process operation are translated into formulation as (multi-criteria) optimisation problems. Trade-offs and selection of system boundaries must be carefully selected for an adequate goal definition. Application of an analytic procedure for control system design requires reliable dynamic plant models, amongst others for control system evaluation. Modelling and identification of activated sludge plants is studied, focusing on Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1) that describes the biological reactions in the plant. For accurate prediction of plant behaviour, calibration of ASM1 model parameters is required. However, still no clear, standard procedures for this task exist. An identifiability analysis is therefore carried out to reveal if sufficient ASM1 parameters can be uniquely estimated from a typical, realistic set of full-scale input/output measurements. A combined criterion for practical identifiability based on the determinant and the condition number of the so-called Fisher Information Matrix proves effective to detect identifiable parameters. Local and global identifiability analysis is carried out on a particular plant assuming perfect knowledge of the transport model. The results show that input/output measurements do not allow unique estimation of all required ASM1 parameters and that additional information is required. One such test to obtain additional information, namely for determination of biodegradable COD, an important quantity in ASM1 modelling, is refined and experimentally tested. For identification in model-based control and for controller design, direct application of the full ASM1 is less suited, due to its size, identifiability problems and stiffness. Model order reduction by timescale separation with singular perturbation theory is therefore studied. Three procedures to test whether timescale separation through singular perturbation is possible are proposed, namely timescale estimation, direct scaling and analytical scaling. They are tested on a relatively simple model system. The timescale estimation procedure proves a very helpful tool in model reduction. It is more straightforward to apply than eigenvalue analysis, because it avoids an ambiguous state-to-eigenvalue association and it provides an error analysis. The analytical scaling procedure provides insight into the cause of time scale multiplicity. It is successful only in a limited number of cases, however and is less generally applicable. The direct scaling procedure is not generally applicable. For the test to determine biodegradable COD mentioned above, a reduced first-order model is derived by applying a quasi-steady-state assumption. The reduced model provides valuable insight, as well as quantitative relationships required for interpretation of this test. The next step in control system design is control structure selection and the actual controller design. Control structure selection includes input/output selection (the selection of sensors and actuators) and controller configuration (their interconnections). For input/output selection in activated sludge process control, a basic model analysis probably suffices once a correct selection of controlled variables has been made. Selection of controlled variables is more difficult. A possible methodology for their selection employs the minimum singular value of the plant transfer matrix, using a model such as ASM1. With respect to control configuration selection, several interactions occur in the activated sludge process. The need for non-interacting control from the perspective of the final control objectives remains to be established, however. The actual controller design, especially the control law selection, is studied with Model Predictive Control as a prototype control technology. MPC performs model-based optimisation on-line, including feedback, and is best suited to deal with realistic optimisation problems under constraints. Linear MPC with constraints is applied to a pre-denitrification plant model and a carrousel model, which both are continuously operated systems. In both systems, stability problems occurred, caused by model mismatch. The results show that MPC with a nonlinear internal model is better suited for economic operation as the internal model can cope with a larger operational range. Moreover, the time-varying characteristics of the activated sludge process argue to include adaptation. To study the need for nonlinear and adaptive control, MPC robustness against state vs. parameter uncertainty is investigated on a simple model using a structured uncertainty description. The results show that state uncertainty has a larger effect than parameter uncertainty. Consequently, nonlinear control development should be given priority over parameter adaptation. However, these conclusions are drawn with caution, because the robustness analysis results are conservative. At the current state-of-art in activated sludge modelling, one should avoid absolute quantitative conclusions when employing models tuned with existing calibration strategies. These do not yield unique parameters, so the physical interpretation of parameters is unclear and consequently prediction accuracy is limited. ASM1 calibration needs further development, as do transport models development and their calibration, especially for distributed systems such as carrousels. Despite of this, models such as ASM1 are most helpful tools in developing straightforward controller design procedures. In combination with mathematical optimisation techniques, they provide a reference point for achievable performance and allow unambiguous evaluation of the effect of all design steps and of model uncertainty on overall process performance. Thus, modelling and optimisation are invaluable for improving process performance and for deciding on suitable control strategies.},

  abstract = {In order to hasten the implementation of optimal, cost-effective and sustainable treatment trains for resource recovery from biowaste, a new nutrient recovery model (NRM) library has been developed and validated at steady state. It includes physico-biochemical mathematical models for anaerobic digestion, struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping and absorption as ammonium sulfate. The present paper describes the use of the NRM library to establish the operational settings of a sustainable and cost-effective treatment scenario with maximal resource (nutrients and biogas) recovery and minimal energy and chemical requirements. Under the optimised conditions and assumptions made, potential financial benefits for a large-scale anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery project treating 2700m3/d of pig manure were estimated at US\$2·8-6·5/m3 based on net variable cost calculations, or an average of ∼\$2/(m3 year), equivalent to \$40/(t total solids year), over 20 years in the best case when also taking into account capital costs. Hence, it is likely that in practice a full-scale zero-cost biorefinery for nutrient and energy recovery from manure can be constructed. As such, this paper demonstrates the potential of the NRM library to facilitate the implementation of sustainable nutrient and energy (biogas) recovery treatment trains for biowaste valorisation.},

The latter will shift the focus of the wastewater industry to how one could manage and extract resources from the wastewater, as opposed to the conventional paradigm of treatment. Debatable questions arise: Can the more complex models be calibrated, or will additional unknowns be introduced? After almost 30 years using well-known International Water Association (IWA) models, should the community move to other components, processes, or model structures like 'black box' models, computational fluid dynamics techniques, etc.? Can new data sources - e.g. on-line sensor data, chemical and molecular analyses, new analytical techniques, off-gas analysis - keep up with the increasing process complexity? Are different methods for data management, data reconciliation, and fault detection mature enough for coping with such a large amount of information? Are the available calibration techniques able to cope with such complex models? This paper describes the thoughts and opinions collected during the closing session of the 6th IWA/WEF Water Resource Recovery Modelling Seminar 2018. It presents a concerted and collective effort by individuals from many different sectors of the wastewater industry to offer past and present insights, as well as an outlook into the future of wastewater modelling.},

However, currently used mechanistic models are limited by an over-simplified representation of local conditions. This is illustrated by the general difficulties in calibrating the latest N2O models and the large variability in parameter values reported in the literature. The use of compartmental model (CM) developed on the basis of accurate hydrodynamic studies using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can take into account local conditions and recirculation patterns in the activated sludge tanks that are important with respect to the modelling objective. The conventional tanks in series (TIS) configuration does not allow this. The aim of the present work is to compare the capabilities of two model layouts (CM and TIS) in defining a realistic domain of parameter values representing the same full-scale plant. A model performance evaluation method is proposed to identify the good operational domain of each parameter in the two layouts. Already when evaluating for steady state, the CM was found to provide better defined parameter ranges than TIS. Dynamic simulations further confirmed the CM's capability to work in a more realistic parameter domain, avoiding unnecessary calibration to compensate for flaws in the spatial submodel.},

Struvite precipitation from wastewater or biological sludge is among the preferred approaches applied for phosphorus recovery, as it results in the availability of valuable fertilizer materials. This process is mostly affected by pH and presence of competitive ions in solution. Modeling and optimization of the precipitation process may help understanding the optimal conditions under which the most efficient recovery could be achieved. In this study, a combination of chemical equilibrium modeling and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to this aim to aerobic sludge from a plant in Italy. The results identify optimum chemical parameters values for best phosphorus precipitation recovery and removal efficiencies, respectively. Identification of optimal conditions for process control is of great importance for implementing pilot scale struvite precipitation and achieve efficient phosphorus recovery.},

Optimal experimental design (OED) is a powerful tool to identify and maximize the information content of measurement data. This paper adopts a model-based OED methodology to efficiently plan a measurement campaign for final model calibration and validation of a new sewer water quality model. To do so, a preliminary calibrated model of the case study is used to evaluate the information content of different potential measurement locations and scenarios for suspended solids as measured variable. The case study first demonstrates how OED can identify the best measurement location within a complex sewer network. It secondly demonstrates that measuring the beginning of a big rain event results in the most information-rich data among all scenarios evaluated. Thirdly, it analyses in detail the information content of dry weather flow (DWF) data. In comparison to previous studies the methodology is improved by considering the actual measurement error characteristics when calculating the information content of measurement data.},

In cases where a detailed hydrodynamic model exists, it is common to start conceptualizing from this detailed counterpart. Unfortunately, no generalized procedure exists, which is surprising as this can be a complex and time-consuming task. This research work proposes a procedure that is validated with two independent combined sewer case studies. The conceptual models provide the targeted results with respect to representation of the flow rates and reduction in the computational time. As the desired performance could be reached for different levels of model aggregation, it is concluded that the conceptual model can be tailored to the points where accurate flow rates need to be predicted. Furthermore, the comparison of the conceptual model results with flow measurements highlights the importance of analyzing and eventually compensating for the limitations of the detailed model.}

  abstract = {Hydrolysis is considered the limiting step during solid waste anaerobic digestion (including co-digestion of sludge and biosolids). Mechanisms of hydrolysis are mechanistically not well understood with detrimental impact on model predictive capability. The common approach to multiple substrates is to consider simultaneous degradation of the substrates. This may not have the capacity to separate the different kinetics. Sequential degradation of substrates is theoretically supported by microbial capacity and the composite nature of substrates (bioaccessibility concept). However, this has not been experimentally assessed. Sequential chemical fractionation has been successfully used to define inputs for an anaerobic digestion model. In this paper, sequential extractions of organic substrates were evaluated in order to compare both models. By removing each fraction (from the most accessible to the least accessible fraction) from three different substrates, anaerobic incubation tests showed that for physically structured substrates, such as activated sludge and wheat straw, sequential approach could better describe experimental results, while this was less important for homogeneous materials such as pulped fruit. Following this, anaerobic incubation tests were performed on five substrates. Cumulative methane production was modelled by the simultaneous and sequential approaches. Results showed that the sequential model could fit the experimental data for all the substrates whereas simultaneous model did not work for some substrates.},

The system was operating at a high organic loading rate averaging 5.8~g~total~CBOD5/m2 of media per day (23.9~g~total~CBOD5/m3 of lagoon per day), a total ammonia nitrogen loading rate averaging 0.9~g~NH4-N/m2~day (3.7~g~NH4-N/m3~day), and temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 20.8°C. The system showed an extended seasonal nitrification period compared with a simulated aerated lagoon system of the same dimensions. This extension of complete nitrification with approximately 1~month was observed in the fall despite the decrease of operating temperature down to 4°C. During this maximum nitrification period, substantial denitrification occurred, and the effluent un-ionized ammonia ratio was reduced. A temporary loss of nitrification was also experienced in relation to an episode of elevated suspended solids concentration. Measured biofilm characteristics, namely the detachment dynamics and the biofilm thickness, were used to explain this temporary nitrification loss. During wintertime, a low nitrate production was still observed, suggesting year-long retention of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilm. Practitioner points: Nitrification in a highly loaded biofilm-enhanced aerated lagoon is mainly affected by operating temperature. Maximum nitrification is observed during the warmer months and occurs even at high organic loading rates ({$>$}5~g~CBOD5/m2~day). Compared with a simulated suspended growth system, the biofilm-enhanced lagoon shows a significantly extended nitrification period. The extension is observed at the end of the summertime maximum nitrification period. Low amounts of nitrate still produced during winter in the biofilm-enhanced aerated lagoon suggest year-long retention of autotrophic nitrifying biomass in the biofilm. Nitrification in the biofilm-enhanced aerated lagoon is negatively impacted by the presence of important quantities of accumulated solids that resuspend when their digestion starts as temperature increases.},

To identify the most relevant trends, we conducted a horizon scan regarding how ubiquitous sensing will shape the future of urban drainage and wastewater management. Our survey of the international urban water community received an active response from both the academics and the professionals from the water industry. The analysis of the responses demonstrates that emerging topics for urban water will often involve experts from different communities, including aquatic ecologists, urban water system engineers and managers, as well as information and communications technology professionals and computer scientists. Activities in topics that are identified as novel will either require (i) cross-disciplinary training, such as importing new developments from the IT sector, or (ii) research in new areas for urban water specialists, for example, to help solve open questions in aquatic ecology. These results are, therefore, a call for interdisciplinary research beyond our own discipline. They also demonstrate that the water management community is not yet prepared for the digital transformation, where we will experience a data demand, i.e. a "pull" of urban water data into external services. The results suggest that a lot remains to be done to harvest the upcoming opportunities. Horizon scanning should be repeated on a routine basis, under the umbrella of an experienced polling organization.},

Theoretical densities of pure crystalline substances can be calculated from the unit cell of the crystal structure. Pure metals, as opposed to alloys, have specific melting temperatures. Most alloys, however, have a range of temperatures, where both liquid and solid phases are present. The specific heat of a material is the heat, or thermal energy, required to raise a given mass by one degree of temperature. The most common units in the modern technical literature are joules per kilogram per degrees Kelvin. The thermal conductivity of a material is the constant relating the steady-state heat flow, in energy per unit area per unit time, to the temperature gradient in degrees per unit length. Thermal conductivity in metals decreases substantially with increases in temperature. The electrical resistivity of a length of wire is its electrical resistance, in ohms, times its cross-sectional area divided by its length. In the case of metals, electrical and thermal conductivity are closely related, since electron motion is the principal vehicle in each case.},

The proposed procedure aims at determining sets of additional measurements (besides available ones) that guarantee the identifiability of key process variables, which means that their value can be calculated from other, measured variables, based on available constraints in the form of linear mass balances. Among all solutions, i.e. all possible sets of additional measurements allowing the identifiability of all key process variables, the optimal solutions were found taking into account two objectives, namely the accuracy of the identified key variables and the cost of additional measurements. The results of this multi-objective optimization problem were represented in a Pareto-optimal front. The presented procedure was applied to a full-scale WWTP. Detailed analysis of the relation between measurements allowed the determination of groups of overlapping mass balances. Adding measured variables could only serve in identifying key variables that appear in the same group of mass balances. Besides, the application of the experimental design procedure to these individual groups significantly reduced the computational effort in evaluating available measurements and planning additional monitoring campaigns. The proposed procedure is straightforward and can be applied to other WWTPs with or without prior data collection.},

All of these models use their own notation, causing problems for documentation, implementation and connection of different models (using different sets of state variables). The main goal of this paper is to propose a new notational framework which allows unique and systematic naming of state variables and parameters of biokinetic models in the wastewater treatment field. The symbols are based on one main letter that gives a general description of the state variable or parameter and several subscript levels that provide greater specification. Only those levels that make the name unique within the model context are needed in creating the symbol. The paper describes specific problems encountered with the currently used notation, presents the proposed framework and provides additional practical examples. The overall result is a framework that can be used in whole plant modelling, which consists of different fields such as activated sludge, anaerobic digestion, sidestream treatment, membrane bioreactors, metabolic approaches, fate of micropollutants and biofilm processes. The main objective of this consensus building paper is to establish a consistent set of rules that can be applied to existing and most importantly, future models.

The Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to evaluate the uncertainty in the BSM1 predictions, considering the ASM1 bio-kinetic parameters and influent fractions as input uncertainties while the Effluent Quality Index (EQI) and the Operating Cost index (OCI) are focused on as model outputs. The resulting Monte Carlo simulations are presented using descriptive statistics indicating the degree of uncertainty in the predicted EQI and OCI. Next, the Standard Regression Coefficients (SRC) method is used for sensitivity analysis to identify which input parameters influence the uncertainty in the EQI predictions the most. The results show that control strategies including an ammonium (SNH) controller reduce uncertainty in both overall pollution removal and effluent total Kjeldahl nitrogen. Also, control strategies with an external carbon source reduce the effluent nitrate (SNO) uncertainty increasing both their economical cost and variability as a trade-off. Finally, the maximum specific autotrophic growth rate (μA) causes most of the variance in the effluent for all the evaluated control strategies.

We have developed a key performance indicator (KPI) visualisation tool for energy and process data embedded in a larger process optimisation software. The KPI set consists of indicator values relating to energy and effluent quality. In order to ensure that the visualisation tool will be used and cover the needs of the plant staff, we developed this part of the software in collaboration with two WWTPs. At the time of writing, the tool is used in the daily operation of both plants. The operators see the tool’s most important advantages as its ability to quickly assess current plant performance and to simplify the tracking and analysis of inter- and intra-process relationships and dynamics.},

  abstract = {High performance querying and ad-hoc querying are commonly viewed as mutually exclusive goals in massively parallel processing databases. Furthermore, there is a contradiction between ease of extending the data model and ease of analysis. The modern 'Data Lake' approach, promises extreme ease of adding new data to a data model, however it is prone to eventually becoming a Data Swamp – unstructured, ungoverned, and out of control Data Lake where due to a lack of process, standards and governance, data is hard to find, hard to use and is consumed out of context. This paper introduces a novel technique, highly normalized Big Data using Anchor modeling, that provides a very efficient way to store information and utilize resources, thereby providing ad-hoc querying with high performance for the first time in massively parallel processing databases. This technique is almost as convenient for expanding data model as a Data Lake, while it is internally protected from transforming to Data Swamp. A case study of how this approach is used for a Data Warehouse at Avito over a three-year period, with estimates for and results of real data experiments carried out in HP Vertica, an MPP RDBMS, is also presented. This paper is an extension of theses from The 34th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2015) (Golov and Rönnbäck 2015) [1], it is complemented with numerical results about key operating areas of highly normalized big data warehouse, collected over several (1–3) years of commercial operation. Also, the limitations, imposed by using a single MPP database cluster, are described, and cluster fragmentation approach is proposed.},

Impact of underperformed basic upstream operations such as drilling and blasting will sustain this inefficiency in downstream processes, such as mineral processing. Data provided for each of these operations from software and hardware utilised on field reached a level where advanced data analytics becomes applicable. Data warehousing and data mining are alternative tools that rely on a robust data structure. This study gives insight into a data-driven framework for modern mines and presents a data mining implementation on real-time mining-related data for prediction of blasting performance. Random forest and adaptive boosting algorithm were utilised on an integrated data warehouse to discover major operational parameters for efficient blasting. The implementation on site improved the performance of drilling and blasting. The variables highlighted as important by random forest and adaptive boosting algorithm directed the experts of mine-to-mill on site to focus on the close control and detailed analysis of certain drilling- and blasting-related parameters.},

One view holds that reliable analytics is impossible without high-quality data, and relies on heavy-duty ETL processes and upfront data curation to provide it. The second view takes a more ad-hoc approach, collecting data into a data lake, and placing responsibility for data quality on the analyst querying it. A third, on-demand approach has emerged over the past decade in the form of numerous systems like Paygo or HLog, which allow for incremental curation of the data and help analysts to make principled trade-offs between data quality and effort. Though quite useful in isolation, these systems target only specific quality problems (e.g., Paygo targets only schema matching and entity resolution). In this paper, we explore the design of a general, extensible infrastructure for on-demand curation that is based on probabilistic query processing. We illustrate its generality through examples and show how such an infrastructure can be used to gracefully make existing ETL work ows "on-demand". Finally, we present a user interface for On-Demand ETL and address ensuing challenges, including that of efficiently ranking potential data curation tasks. Our experimental results show that On-Demand ETL is feasible and that our greedy ranking strategy for curation tasks, called CPI, is effiective. © 2015 VLDB Endowment 2150-8097/15/08.},

The building process of IDDW starts with the identification of various locations where DW may be built. Initially, a single location is considered at top-most level of IDDW where DW is built. Thereafter, DW at any other location of any level may be built. A method, to transfer concerned data from any upper level DW to concerned lower level DW, is also presented in the paper.

End-user computing performance depends on the user-database interface, in which the data model and query language are major components. We examined three prominent data models-the relational model, the Extended-Entity-Relationship (EER) model, and the Object-Oriented (OO) model-and their query languages in a rigorous and systematic experiment to evaluate their effects on novice end-user computing performance in the context of database design and data manipulation. In addition, relationships among the performances for different tasks (modeling, query writing, query comprehension) were postulated with the use of a cognitive model for the query process, and are tested in the experiment. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were used to examine the multiple causal relationships simultaneously. The findings indicate that the EER and OO models overwhelmingly outperformed the relational model in terms of accuracy for both database design and data manipulation. The associations between tasks suggest that data modeling techniques would enhance query writing correctness, and query writing ability would contribute to query comprehension. This study provides a better and thorough understanding of the inter-relationships among these data modeling and task factors. Our findings have significant implications for novice end-user training and development. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

Knowing the accuracy of an organization's data reflects the level of reliability it can assign to them in decision-making processes. Measuring data accuracy in Big Data environment is a process that involves comparing data to assess with some "reference data" considered by the system to be correct. However, such a process can be complex or even impossible in the absence of appropriate reference data. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose an approach to obtain the reference data thanks to the emergence of Big Data technologies. Our approach is based on the upstream selection of a set of criteria that we define as "Accuracy Criteria". We use furthermore a set of techniques such as Big Data Sampling, Schema Matching, Record Linkage, and Similarity Measurement. The proposed model and experiment results allow us to be more confident in the importance of data quality assessment solution and the configuration of the accuracy criteria to automate the selection of reference data in a Data Lake.},

One the most relevant of these perturbations is weather. In fact, different weather conditions imply different inflow rates and substance (e.g., N-ammonia, which is among the most important) concentrations. Therefore, weather has traditionally been an important signal that operators take into account to tune WWTP control systems. This signal cannot be directly measured with traditional physical sensors. Nevertheless, machine learning-based soft-sensors can be used to predict non-observable measures by means of available data. In this paper, we present novel research about a new soft-sensor that predicts the current weather signal. This weather prediction differs from traditional weather forecasting since this soft-sensor predicts the weather conditions as an operator does when controling the WWTP. This prediction uses a model based on past WWTP influent states measured by only a few physical and widely applied sensors. The results are encouraging, as we obtained a good accuracy level for a relevant and very useful signal when applied to advanced WWTP control systems.},

  abstract = {Due to increased food production, the demand for nitrogen and phosphorus as fertilizers grows. Nitrogen-based fertilizers are produced with the Haber–Bosch process through the industrial fixation of N2 into ammonia. Through wastewater treatment, the nitrogen is finally released back to the atmosphere as N2 gas. This nitrogen cycle is characterized by drawbacks. The energy requirement is high, and in the wastewater treatment, nitrogen is mainly converted to N2 gas and lost to the atmosphere. In this study, technologies for nitrogen recovery from wastewater were selected based on four criteria: sustainability (energy use and N2O emissions), the potential to recover nitrogen in an applicable form, the maturity of the technology, and the nitrogen concentration that can be handled by the technology. As in wastewater treatment, the focus is also on the recovery of other resources; the interactions of nitrogen recovery with biogas production, phosphorus recovery, and cellulose recovery were examined. The mutual interference of the several nitrogen recovery technologies was studied using adaptive policy making. The most promising mature technologies that can be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment plants include struvite precipitation, the treatment of digester reject water by air stripping, vacuum membrane filtration, hydrophobic membrane filtration, and treatment of air from thermal sludge drying, resulting respectively in 1.1\%, 24\%, 75\%, 75\%, and 2.1\% nitrogen recovery for the specific case wastewater treatment plant Amsterdam-West. The effects on sustainability were limited. Higher nitrogen recovery (60\%) could be realized by separate urine collection, but this requires a completely new infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. It was concluded that different technologies in parallel are required to reach sustainable solutions. Nitrogen recovery does not interfere with the recovery of the other resources. An adaptation pathways map is a good tool to take into account new developments, uncertainties, and different ambitions when choosing technologies for nitrogen recovery.},

This paper suggests a simple way of using on-line ammonium measurements to control aeration in a pre-denitrification plant by controlling the dissolved oxygen setpoint. The controller works primarily by feed-forward based on an ammonium sensor located at the head of the aerobic process part. Using online in-situ sensor measurements directly from the process have the important advantage over effluent measurements that there is no or very short time delay for information. The controller has been implemented in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant for a period of 35 days. During the experiment two identical activated sludge lines were used. The controller was implemented in one line, while the other line worked as a reference for comparison. The preliminary results indicate that the described control strategy leads to energy savings for the aeration in the region of 5-15\%, while maintaining approximately the same effluent quality as in the reference line. Even higher energy savings can probably be achieved by optimising the controller.

  abstract = {This work describes the development of an intermittently aerated pilot-scale process (V=0.45m3) operated for optimized efficient nitrogen removal in terms of volume, supplemental carbon and alkalinity requirements. The intermittent aeration pattern was controlled using a strategy based on effluent ammonia concentration set-points. The unique feature of the ammonia-based aeration control was that a fixed dissolved oxygen (DO) set-point was used and the length of the aerobic and anoxic time (anoxic time ≥25\% of total cycle time) were changed based on the effluent ammonia concentration. Unlike continuously aerated ammonia-based aeration control strategies, this approach offered control over the aerobic solids retention time (SRT) to deal with fluctuating ammonia loading without solely relying on changes to the total SRT. This approach allowed the system to be operated at a total SRT with a small safety factor. The benefits of operating at an aggressive SRT were reduced hydraulic retention time (HRT) for nitrogen removal. As a result of such an operation, nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) out-selection was also obtained (ammonia oxidizing bacteria [AOB] maximum activity: 400±79mgN/L/d, NOB maximum activity: 257±133mgN/L/d, P{$<$}0.001) expanding opportunities for short-cut nitrogen removal. The pilot demonstrated a total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal rate of 95±30mgN/L/d at an influent chemical oxygen demand: ammonia (COD/NH4+-N) ratio of 10.2±2.2 at 25°C within the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4h and within a total SRT of 5-10 days. The TIN removal efficiency up to 91\% was observed during the study, while effluent TIN was 9.6±4.4mgN/L. Therefore, this pilot-scale study demonstrates that application of the proposed on-line aeration control is capable of relatively high nitrogen removal without supplemental carbon and alkalinity addition at a low HRT.},

To this end, methods are presented for the design of advanced fault-tolerant control systems for chemical processes which explicitly deal with actuator/controller failures and sensor faults and data losses. Specifically, the book puts forward: A framework for detection, isolation and diagnosis of actuator and sensor faults for nonlinear systems; Controller reconfiguration and safe-parking-based fault-handling methodologies; Integrated-data- and model-based fault-detection and isolation and fault-tolerant control methods; Methods for handling sensor faults and data losses; and Methods for monitoring the performance of low-level PID loops. The methodologies proposed employ nonlinear systems analysis, Lyapunov techniques, optimization, statistical methods and hybrid systems theory and are predicated upon the idea of integrating fault-detection, local feedback control, and supervisory control. The applicability and performance of the methods are demonstrated through a number of chemical process examples. Fault-Tolerant Process Control is a valuable resource for academic researchers, industrial practitioners as well as graduate students pursuing research in this area.},

The effluent of high-rate activated sludge process (hydraulic retention time, HRT = 30 min, solids retention time = 0.25 d) was fed to the pilot plant described in this paper, where a constant temperature of 23 °C was maintained. The nitritation-denitritation process was operated to promote nitrite oxidizing bacteria out-selection in an intermittently aerated reactor. The intermittent aeration pattern was controlled using a strategy based on effluent ammonia and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. The unique feature of this aeration control was that fixed dissolved oxygen set-point was used and the length of aerobic and anoxic durations were changed based on the effluent ammonia and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. The anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) bacteria were adapted in mainstream conditions by allowing the growth on the moving bed bioreactor plastic media in a fully anoxic reactor. The total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal performance of the entire system was 75 ± 15\% during the study at a modest influent chemical oxygen demand (COD)/NH4+-N ratio of 8.9 ± 1.8 within the HRT range of 3.1-9.4 h. Anammox polishing contributed 11\% of overall TIN removal.

The final control strategy combines three complementary control loops to optimise the nitrogen removal in pre-denitrifying activated sludge plants. The first controller was designed to maintain the average concentration of the ammonia in the effluent via the automatic selection of the most appropriate DO set point in the aerobic reactors. The second control loop optimises the use of the denitrification potential and finally, the third control loop maintains the selected amount of biomass in the biological reactors by automatic manipulation of the wastage rate. Mobile-averaged windows have been implemented to incorporate commonly used averaged values in the control objectives.

The estimated values of the two key variables were then used to derive an adaptive model-based DO control law using the soft sensing ability of the GDLS. Simulation results show that the GDLS algorithm gives excellent estimations of the respiration rate under closed loop control, and that model-based DO control can efficiently deal with changes in the operating condition.},

  abstract = {The increasing attention paid to the environment has led to a reduction in the emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Moreover, the increasing interest in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from WWTPs suggests that we reconsider the traditional tools used for designing and managing WWTPs. Indeed, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane can be emitted from wastewater treatment, significantly contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. The reduction of energy consumption as well as GHG emission are of particular concern for large WWTPs which treat the majority of wastewater in terms of both volume and pollution load. Nowadays, there is an increasing need to develop new tools that include additional performance indicators related to GHG emissions and energy consumption as well as traditional effluent quality parameters. Energy consumption, in fact, can be considered as an indirect source of GHGs. This paper presents the development of an ongoing research project aiming at setting-up an innovative mathematical model platform for the design and management of WWTPs. The final goal of the project by means of this platform is to minimize the environmental impact of WWTPs through their optimization in terms of energy consumptions and emissions, which can be regarded as discharged pollutants, sludge and GHGs.},

In parallel, a dynamical model of the complete wastewater plant was developed according to the specific kinetic characteristics of the sludge and the highly varying composition of the industrial wastewater. Based on real-time data and dynamic models, control strategies for the equalisation system, the polymer dosing and phosphorus addition were established. The control strategies are being integrated in the existing SCADA system combining traditional PLC technology with robust PC based control calculations. The use of intelligent control in wastewater treatment offers a wide spectrum of possibilities to upgrade existing plants, to increase the capacity of the plant and to eliminate peaks. This can result in a more stable and secure overall performance and, finally, in cost savings. The use of on-line sensors has a potential not only for monitoring concentrations, but also for manipulating flows and concentrations. This way the performance of the plant can be secured.},

This paper is concerned with the development and application of a systematic, model-based methodology for the development of wastewater resource recovery systems that are both economically attractive and sustainable. With the array of available treatment and recovery options growing steadily, a superstructure modeling approach based on rigorous mathematical optimization appears to be a natural approach for tackling these problems. The development of reliable, yet simple, performance and cost models is a key issue with this approach in order to allow for a reliable solution based on global optimization. We argue that commercial wastewater simulators can be used to derive such models, and we illustrate this approach with a simple resource recovery system. The results show that the proposed methodology is computationally tractable, thereby supporting its application as a decision support system for selection of promising resource recovery systems whose development is worth pursuing.},

A wealth of real-time information was collected, supplementing simulation data and water sampling results. The concept of ESS drew attention to benefits that tend to be ignored in standard evaluations. It is, however, most elaborate for ecological services, and less developed for social aspects. Involving the citizens complemented the framework in these areas, while providing new insights into the contextual interactions influencing ESS and benefits of local treatment. Both solutions, a cross-flow lamella settler and a high-rate filtration system, were quite efficient in removing suspended solids, with a strong impact on visual appearance. A range of wider benefits were identified. These were difficult to monetize, but the citizens’ evaluation provided an alternative measure. The study highlights the benefits of citizen science in local water management and suggests the need for more research on beneficiaries in ESS evaluation.},

The time series of rainfall and influent in dry weather conditions are generated using two types of statistical models. These two time series serve as inputs to a conceptual sewer model for generation of influent time series. The application of the proposed influent generator to the Eindhoven WWTP shows that it is a powerful tool for realistic generation of influent time series and is well-suited for probabilistic design of WWTPs as it considers both the effect of input variability and total model uncertainty.},

A useful framework for this is the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The difficulties in implementing this kind of control chart program are identifying an adequate model, estimating the model's parameters, organizing the day-to-day computations, and recognizing when the model becomes inadequate and must be reconstructed and refitted. A small family of models was investigated for a number of data series. The use of simple graphical methods and external reference distributions as substitutes for control charts is discussed.]},

In this empirical model, which does not need flow as a predictor variable, the stochastic component is much more important than the transfer function component.

  abstract = {In this paper, a control approach for improving the overall efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is presented. It consists of a cascaded control system that uses a global performance indicator as the controlled variable to drive the plant to operating conditions that satisfies trade-offs involved in the WWTP operation, improving the global performance of the plant. The selected global performance indicator is the N/E index that measures the ratio between the amount of nitrogenated compounds eliminated (kgN) and the energy (kWh) required to achieve that goal. This index links the variables of the activated sludge process with the energy consumed in the whole plant, thus the control strategy takes actions based on plantwide considerations. An external Proportional Integral (PI) controller changes the DO set point according to the N/E index and the basic dissolved oxygen (DO) control scheme in the activated sludge process follows this reference changes varying the aeration intensity. An outer loop with an event-based controller is used to compute the index values when the DO concentration is driven to excessively low limits, preventing long operation periods in this undesirable condition. Simple proportional integral controllers (PI) are used to adapt the strategy to the automation systems available in WWTPs. The implementation in the Benchmark Simulation Model 2 (BSM2) demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach. The results show the possibilities of the N/E index to be used as an indicator of global performance of WWTPs. It provides a link between water line objectives and energy consumption in the whole plant that can be exploited to introduce plantwide considerations in alternative control strategies formulated to drive the plant to operating conditions that optimize the overall process efficiency.},

Specifically, we take advantage of the benchmark simulation model no. 1 provided by the International Water Association to simulate a biological wastewater treatment plant. A computationally efficient EMPC developed recently is adopted in this work to optimize the effluent quality and operating cost directly. The performance of the EMPC is compared with a proportional-integral (PI) control scheme and a regular tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme from different perspectives including effluent quality and operating cost. The simulation results demonstrate that EMPC has the potential to significantly improve effluent quality and reduce operating cost simultaneously compared with PI and MPC schemes.},

Secondly, this paper introduces a detailed energy cost model based on a Spanish energy tariff structure coupled with a WRRF process model to evaluate several control strategies and provide insights into the selection of the contracted power structure. The results for a 1-year evaluation on a 115,000 population-equivalent WRRF showed monthly cost differences ranging from 7 to 30\% when comparing the detailed energy cost model to an average energy price. The evaluation of different aeration control strategies also showed that using average energy prices and neglecting energy tariff structures may lead to biased conclusions when selecting operating strategies or comparing technologies or equipment. The proposed framework demonstrated that for cost minimization, control strategies should be paired with a specific optimal contracted power. Hence, the design of operational and control strategies must take into account the local energy tariff.},

  abstract = {Aeration control at wastewater treatment plants based on ammonia as the controlled variable is applied for one of two reasons: (1) to reduce aeration costs, or (2) to reduce peaks in effluent ammonia. Aeration limitation has proven to result in significant energy savings, may reduce external carbon addition, and can improve denitrification and biological phosphorus (bio-P) performance. Ammonia control for limiting aeration has been based mainly on feedback control to constrain complete nitrification by maintaining approximately one to two milligrams of nitrogen per liter of ammonia in the effluent. Increased attention has been given to feedforward ammonia control, where aeration control is based on monitoring influent ammonia load. Typically, the intent is to anticipate the impact of sudden load changes, and thereby reduce effluent ammonia peaks. This paper evaluates the fundamentals of ammonia control with a primary focus on feedforward control concepts. A case study discussion is presented that reviews different ammonia-based control approaches. In most instances, feedback control meets the objectives for both aeration limitation and containment of effluent ammonia peaks. Feedforward control, applied specifically for switching aeration on or off in swing zones, can be beneficial when the plant encounters particularly unusual influent disturbances.},

Development of energy savings strategies for the highly energy-intensive batch process is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the process and lack of measurements due to the harsh operating conditions. Here we introduce a new energy management approach that effectively curtails the energy cost in real-time through the implementation of economically optimal operating decisions. An economics- oriented shrinking horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm that exploits time-varying electricity prices is coupled with a multi-rate moving horizon estimator (MHE) to form an integrated decision- making framework. With a detailed first-principles dynamic model functioning at the core, the multi-variable interactions and plant variations are successfully incorporated into the control strategy to achieve reliable performance. We also present a novel initialization scheme for obtaining fast on-line solutions of the economic NMPC and multi-rate MHE dynamic optimization problems. Using this initialization algorithm, we show that the optimal input decisions are obtained with sufficient computational speed for real-time implementation. The energy usage optimization results indicate a significant reduction in the operating cost and peak electricity demand compared to the case where the electricity price profile is not updated.},

  abstract = {Developing a Sensor Strategy for Toronto 'Lots of data, not enough information' seems to be a common perspective shared by wastewater operators and managers the world over. While online instruments can be a powerful tool for operations, sensors in the aggressive environment of wastewater especially need significant attention and upkeep. The City of Toronto operates four wastewater treatment facilities, collectively serving an equivalent population of 2.8 million. At all four facilities, there is a history of sensor installations that were not fully supported and produced poor quality data over long periods of time. Whether sensors are there to support real-time control or to provide information only, the more 'bad data' there is in the system, the less confidence all users of process data have and the less useful the sensors are. While good work is done by instrument technicians, a gap exists in sensor validation/verification and ownership of data. After learning from both successful and unsuccessful sensor installations and automation projects, the City is moving toward a new approach for managing sensor data quality (see Figure 1). It is intended to be an overarching approach to managing sensors and the data they produce. At the heart of the strategy will be the principle that when deciding to install a sensor, you must commit to support and maintenance over its entire lifecycle through to decommissioning. At the 'Design' stage, the strategy requires that engineers weigh the value of the information a new sensor will provide against the full cost of ownership. In some cases, the data being obtained from an existing sensor may not be valuable enough to justify the sensor's lifecycle cost including replacement cost, chemicals, cleaning, calibration, repairs and output data verification. If a sensor is not needed for real-time automatic control, to meet regulatory requirements, or to provide a critical early indication of operational problems, it may be less expensive and better serve operational needs to collect handheld sensor readings or grab samples for lab analysis. In the 'Operation' phase of the sensor strategy, fault detection and response are important. The City's planned approach is simple: for each sensor, make a data verification chart available to anyone with access to plant data (operators, engineers and managers). The chart will plot the sensor's output against a reference measurement (a lab sample, handheld instrument reading or operator test). While more complex fault detection methods exist, this basic method will be understandable to all users and can be made more sophisticated in the future. The biggest challenge in implementing the sensor strategy will be to connect all the job roles that support the sensors and coordinate their efforts. At the sensor's 'End of Life', it must be replaced or properly decommissioned (including from SCADA, operations manuals, drawings, etc.). Data Management Platform Replacement In a separate but related initiative, Toronto Water is re-examining its approach to managing data and turning it into actionable information. Current platforms in use at the City include a GE iFix SCADA system, an in-house data warehouse called eOps, and SAP's Business Objects Edge suite. Using these tools, LIMS and SCADA data are brought together and reports are automatically generated and emailed out to supervisors and engineers on a schedule. While existing tools are providing useful information for operations, there are some 'pain points' and gaps that led the City to explore other options available for data management. In June of 2017, a cross-functional team called the Operational Intelligence Group was formed. Staff at Toronto were becoming aware that off-the-shelf IT platforms existed offering significant functionalities and self-serve abilities at relatively low cost. The goal of the group was to learn about commercially available data management platforms. Team members were selected to include representation from Wastewater, Drinking Water, Process Control Systems, Integrated Technology Management and Asset Management, and included the 'power users' of existing data management tools. Vendor presentations were arranged and the following criteria were explored for each platform: • Details on functionalities, • Where the platform would fit into Toronto's existing IT architecture, • Budgetary costs, technical support \& local presence, • What separates it from other available products, • Potential for future integration with other systems/scalability, and • Reference information from other utilities. The exploration of different platforms led to many collective insights on what features were important to Toronto. Some features (such as availability of 24/7 support, data preparation features, mobile apps, complex calculation \& programming tools) are available in most of the available products, whereas other features (fit-for-purpose, auditable e-logbooks, managed workflows \& triggered reports) were less common. Going through the investigation enabled the group to more confidently develop a detailed list of requirements, knowing that required functionalities were available 'off the shelf'. An informal survey was also conducted into what other utilities in Canada, the US, Sweden and the Netherlands are doing with respect to data management. This investigation provided context and increased the group's confidence that an off-the-shelf solution made sense for us, rather than building our own data warehouse or highly customized data management tool. Anecdotal evidence seems to show that utilities that have invested in this approach (including Toronto in the past) spend a long time building their systems, which in the end do not have equivalent functionalities to the off-the-shelf tools. Once implemented, maintaining the custom systems and curated data warehouses also seems to require a significant effort that utilities have not always been able to sustain. In February 2018, the group selected a new data management platform. Procurement is underway, and a phased rollout at two of Toronto's eight water and wastewater facilities is being planned for spring 2019. In addition to the initial support required for feature buildout and training, provisions are being made for long-term support for the tool including internal IT support, data governance considerations, and phased decommissioning of the old tools.},

Now, with the wide diffusion of NoSQL databases holding semi-structured data, there is a growing need for enabling OLAP on document stores as well, to allow non-expert users to get new insights and make better decisions. Unfortunately, due to their schemaless nature, document stores are hardly accessible via direct OLAP querying. In this paper we propose EXODUS, an interactive, schema-on-read approach to enable OLAP querying of document stores in the context of self-service BI and exploratory OLAP. To discover multidimensional hierarchies in document stores we adopt a data-driven approach based on the mining of approximate functional dependencies; to ensure good performances, we incrementally build local portions of hierarchies for the levels involved in the current user query. Users execute an analysis session by expressing well-formed multidimensional queries related by OLAP operations; these queries are then translated into the native query language of MongoDB, one of the most popular document-based DBMS. An experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows the efficiency of our approach and its compatibility with a real-time setting.},

  abstract = {Data-driven modeling techniques are applied to process data from wastewater treatment plants to provide valuable additional information for optimal plant control. The application of data-driven modeling techniques, however, bears some risk because the generated models are of non-mechanistic nature and they thus do not always describe the plant processes appropriately. In this study, a procedure to build software sensors based on sensor data available in the process information system is defined and used to compare several techniques suitable for data-driven modeling, including generalized least squares regression, artificial neural networks, self-organizing maps and random forests. Three different degrees of expert knowledge are defined and considered mainly for optimum input signal selection and model interpretation. In two full-scale experiments, software sensors are created. The experiments reveal that even with linear modeling techniques, it is possible to automatically generate accurate software sensors. Hence, this justifies the selection of the most parsimonious and transparent models and to motivate their investigation by taking into account available expert knowledge. A high degree of expert knowledge is valuable for long-term accuracy, but can lead to performance decreases in short-term predictions. With regard to safe on-site deployment, the consideration of uncertainty measures is crucial to prevent misinterpretation of software-sensor outputs in the cases of rare events or model input failures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new nonlinear process monitoring technique based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is developed. KPCA has emerged in recent years as a promising method for tackling nonlinear systems. KPCA can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces by means of integral operators and nonlinear kernel functions. The basic idea of KPCA is to first map the input space into a feature space via nonlinear mapping and then to compute the principal components in that feature space. In comparison to other nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) techniques, KPCA requires only the solution of an eigenvalue problem and does not entail any nonlinear optimization. In addition, the number of principal components need not be specified prior to modeling. In this paper, a simple approach to calculating the squared prediction error (SPE) in the feature space is also suggested. Based on T2 and SPE charts in the feature space, KPCA was applied to fault detection in two example systems: a simple multivariate process and the simulation benchmark of the biological wastewater treatment process. The proposed approach effectively captured the nonlinear relationship in the process variables and showed superior process monitoring performance compared to linear PCA. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Activated sludge models (ASMs) have been widely used for process design, operation and optimization in wastewater treatment plants. However, it is still a challenge to achieve an efficient calibration for reliable application by using the conventional approaches. Hereby, we propose a novel calibration protocol, i.e. Numerical Optimal Approaching Procedure (NOAP), for the systematic calibration of ASMs. The NOAP consists of three key steps in an iterative scheme flow: i) global factors sensitivity analysis for factors fixing; ii) pseudo-global parameter correlation analysis for non-identifiable factors detection; and iii) formation of a parameter subset through an estimation by using genetic algorithm. The validity and applicability are confirmed using experimental data obtained from two independent wastewater treatment systems, including a sequencing batch reactor and a continuous stirred-tank reactor. The results indicate that the NOAP can effectively determine the optimal parameter subset and successfully perform model calibration and validation for these two different systems. The proposed NOAP is expected to use for automatic calibration of ASMs and be applied potentially to other ordinary differential equations models.},

A systematic model calibration procedure was therefore defined and evaluated for a municipal-industrial wastewater treatment plant. In the case that was studied it was important to have a detailed description of the process dynamics, since the model was to be used as the basis for optimisation scenarios in a later phase. Therefore, a complete model calibration procedure was applied including: (1) a description of the hydraulics in the system via a tracer test, (2) an intensive measuring campaign and (3) supporting lab-scale experiments to obtain and confirm kinetic parameters for the model. In this paper the model calibration procedure for this case study is described step by step, and the importance of the different steps is discussed. The calibrated model was evaluated via a sensitivity analysis on the influence of model parameters and influent component concentrations on the model output. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the model output was sensitive to the parameters that were modified from the default parameter values. The calibrated model was finally reduced from a 24 tanks-in-series configuration to a 12 tanks-in-series configuration, resulting in a 50\% reduction of the simulation time.},

Any free parameters in the model are then adjusted to make the fit between the outputs as good as possible.

Using a systematic database reduction procedure, a 3- to 5-fold improvement of model simulation speeds was obtained as compared to using full standard thermodynamic databases. Missing components and reactions in existing standard databases were discovered. Hence, a generic nutrient recovery database was created for future applications. The models were verified and validated against a range of experimental results. Their functionality in terms of increased process understanding and optimization was demonstrated.},

In-stream (immission) concentrations and populations need to comply with certain standards. In order to deal with this new legislation, integrated urban water management is an important issue. Real-time control (RTC) is one approach that may be used to improve the performance of the system. Immission-based RTC has been suggested as a proper instrument to help fulfilling the WFD requirements. In order to design and tune an immission-based RTC scheme and to judge the overall effect on the receiving water, an integrated mathematical model of the urban wastewater system is necessary. Several problems are encountered when creating such a model and solutions are discussed in this paper. With this integrated model, an immission-based control strategy is developed for a particular case study and is shown to be able to improve the water quality compared to the uncontrolled case. In the final part, the robustness of this control strategy is tested, as an important additional measure of performance. It can be concluded that there are tools available to help dealing with the operational consequences of the WFD. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A model-based approach was utilized to simulate the impact of individual features of process control strategies to achieve NO2--N shunt via NOB out-selection. Simulations were conducted using a two-step nitrogen removal model from the literature. Nitrogen shortcut removal processes from two case studies were modeled to illustrate the contribution of NOB out-selection mechanisms. The paper highlights a comparison between two control schemes; one was based on online measured ammonia and the other was based on a target ratio of 1 for ammonia vs. NOx (nitrate + nitrite) (AVN). Results indicated that the AVN controller possesses unique features to nitrify only that amount of nitrogen that can be denitrifi ed, which promotes better management of incoming organics and bicarbonate for a more efficient NOB out-selection. Finally, the model was used in a scenario analysis, simulating hypothetical optimized performance of the pilot process. An estimated potential saving of 60\% in carbon addition for nitrogen removal by implementing full-scale mainstream deammonification was predicted.},

It enables local devices towards integration into higher-level supervisory/management structures and assures communication among same level systems. In the wastewater industry, local automation and SCADA structures are functioning independently in most situations and sometimes implemented using proprietary protocols causing higher-level integration and scalability/extensibility problems. With interdependences at the process level but without correlation in a higher-level supervisory algorithm, some real scenarios are causing undesired behaviors (e.g. wastewater overflows, untreated wastewater directed through bypasses into outlet). The current paper proposes a higher-level control solution (HLCS) that is modularly implemented inside a OPC UA based wrapper. The solution is designed for wastewater pumping stations and wastewater treatment plant to optimize their behavior as a group. Besides achieving interoperability of structures, the noninvasive character of the solution eliminates specific and frequent problems of interference in local functioning systems.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted from wastewater treatment that contribute to its carbon footprint. As a result of the increasing awareness of GHG emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), new modelling, design, and operational tools have been developed to address and reduce GHG emissions at the plant-wide scale and beyond. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and the recently developed tools used to understand and manage GHG emissions from WWTPs, and discusses open problems and research gaps. The literature review reveals that knowledge on the processes related to N 2 O formation, especially due to autotrophic biomass, is still incomplete. The literature review shows also that a plant-wide modelling approach that includes GHG is the best option for the understanding how to reduce the carbon footprint of WWTPs. Indeed, several studies have confirmed that a wide vision of the WWPTs has to be considered in order to make them more sustainable as possible. Mechanistic dynamic models were demonstrated as the most comprehensive and reliable tools for GHG assessment. Very few plant-wide GHG modelling studies have been applied to real WWTPs due to the huge difficulties related to data availability and the model complexity. For further improvement in GHG plant-wide modelling and to favour its use at large real scale, knowledge of the mechanisms involved in GHG formation and release, and data acquisition must be enhanced.},

  abstract = {To enhance energy production from methane or resource recovery from digestate, anaerobic digestion processes require advanced instrumentation and control tools. Over the years, research on these topics has evolved and followed the main fields of application of anaerobic digestion processes: from municipal sewage sludge to liquid—mainly industrial—then municipal organic fraction of solid waste and agricultural residues. Time constants of the processes have also changed with respect to the treated waste from minutes or hours to weeks or months. Since fast closed loop control is needed for short time constant processes, human operator is now included in the loop when taking decisions to optimize anaerobic digestion plants dealing with complex solid waste over a long retention time. Control objectives have also moved from the regulation of key variables—measured on-line—to the prediction of overall process performance—based on global off-line measurements—to optimize the feeding of the processes. Additionally, the need for more accurate prediction of methane production and organic matter biodegradation has impacted the complexity of instrumentation and should include a more detailed characterization of the waste (e.g., biochemical fractions like proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) and their bioaccessibility and biodegradability characteristics. However, even if in the literature several methodologies have been developed to determine biodegradability based on organic matter characterization, only a few papers deal with bioaccessibility assessment. In this review, we emphasize the high potential of some promising techniques, such as spectral analysis, and we discuss issues that could appear in the near future concerning control of AD processes.},

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

Most modelling studies neglect the inherent complexity of the aeration systems used. Typically, the blowers, air piping, and diffusers are not modelled in detail, completely mixed reactors in a series are used to represent plug-flow reactors, and empirical correlations are used to describe the impact of operating conditions on bubble formation and transport, and oxygen transfer from the bubbles to the bulk liquid. However, the mechanisms involved are very complex in nature and require significant research efforts. This contribution highlights why and where there is a need for more detail in the different aspects of the aeration system and compiles recent efforts to develop physical models of the entire aeration system (blower, valves, air piping and diffusers), as well as adding rigour to the oxygen transfer efficiency modelling (impact of viscosity, bubble size distribution, shear and hydrodynamics). As a result of these model extensions, more realistic predictions of dissolved oxygen profiles and energy consumption have been achieved. Finally, the current needs for further model development are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Biological processes exhibit different behavior depending on the influent loads, temperature, microorganism activity, and soon. It has been shown that a combination of several models can provide a suitable approach to model such processes. In the present study, we developed a multiple statistical model approach for the monitoring of biological batch processes. The proposed method consists of four main components: (1) multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data and to remove collinearty; (2) multiple models with a;posterior probability for modeling different operating regions; (3) local batch monitoring by the T-2- and Q-statistics of the specific local model; and (4) a new discrimination measure (DM) to identify when the system has shifted to a new operating condition. Under this approach, local monitoring by multiple models divides the entire historical data set into separate regions, which are then modeled separately. Then; these local regions can be supervised separately; leading to more effective batch monitoring. The proposed method is applied to a pilot-scale 80-L sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for biological wastewater treatment. This SBR is characterized by nonstationary, batchwise, and multiple operation modes. The results obtained for the pilot-scale SBR indicate that the proposed method has the ability to model multiple operating conditions, to identify various operating regions, and also to determine whether the biosystem has shifted to a new operating condition. Our findings show that the local monitoring approach can give more reliable and higher resolution monitoring results than the global model. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

  abstract = {Observations of a hydrologic system response are needed to accurately model system behaviour. Nevertheless, often very few monitoring stations are operated because collecting such reference data adequately and accurately is laborious and costly. It has been recently suggested to use observations not only from dedicated flow meters but also from simpler sensors, such as level or event detectors, which are available more frequently but only provide censored information. Binary observations can be considered as extreme censoring. It is still unclear, however, how to use censored observations most effectively to learn about model parameters. To this end, we suggest a formal likelihood function that incorporates censored observations, while accounting for model structure deficits and uncertainty in input data. Using this likelihood function, the parameter inference is performed within the Bayesian framework. We demonstrate the implementation of our methodology on a case study of an urban catchment, where we estimate the parameters of a hydrodynamic rainfall-runoff model from binary observations of combined sewer overflows. Our results show, first, that censored observations make it possible to learn about model parameters, with an average decrease of 45\% in parameter standard deviation from prior to posterior. Second, the inference substantially improves model predictions, providing higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Third, the gain in information largely depends on the experimental design, i.e. sensor placement. Given the advent of Internet of Things, we foresee that the plethora of censored data promised to be available can be used for parameter estimation within a formal Bayesian framework.},

The forecast model utilizes a simple representation of daily NH4+ profiles and the dilution approach combined with information from online NH4+ and flow sensors. The method utilizes an ensemble approach based on past observations to create model prediction bounds. The forecast model was tested against observations collected at the inlet of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) over an 11-month period. NH4+ data were collected with ion-selective sensors. The model performance evaluation focused on applications in relation to online control strategies. The results of the monitoring campaigns highlighted a high variability in daily NH4+ profiles, stressing the importance of an uncertainty-based modelling approach. The maintenance of the NH4+ sensors resulted in important variations of the sensor signal, affecting the evaluation of the model structure and its performance. The forecast model succeeded in providing outputs that potentially can be used for integrated control of wastewater systems. This study provides insights on full scale application of online water quality forecasting models in sewer systems. It also highlights several research gaps which - if further investigated - can lead to better forecasts and more effective real-time operations of sewer and WWTP systems.},

Each model considers one of the two known N2O production pathways by AOB, namely the AOB denitrification pathway and the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway, with specific kinetic expressions. Satisfactory calibration could be obtained in most cases, but none of the models was able to describe all the N2O data obtained in the different systems with a similar parameter set. Variability of the parameters can be related to difficulties related to undescribed local concentration heterogeneities, physiological adaptation of micro-organisms, a microbial population switch, or regulation between multiple AOB pathways. This variability could be due to a dependence of the N2O production pathways on the nitrite (or free nitrous acid-FNA) concentrations and other operational conditions in different systems. This work gives an overview of the potentialities and limits of single AOB pathway models. Indicating in which condition each single pathway model is likely to explain the experimental observations, this work will also facilitate future work on models in which the two main N2O pathways active in AOB are represented together.},

The ultimate goal is to describe in a unified way the processes taking place both in primary settling tanks (PSTs) and secondary settling tanks (SSTs) for a more detailed operation and control. First, experimental evidence is provided, pointing out distributed particle properties (such as size, shape, density, porosity, and flocculation state) as an important common source of distributed settling behaviour in different settling unit processes and throughout different settling regimes (discrete, hindered and compression settling). Subsequently, a unified model framework that considers several particle classes is proposed in order to describe distributions in settling behaviour as well as the effect of variations in particle properties on the settling process. The result is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are valid from dilute concentrations, where they correspond to discrete settling, to concentrated suspensions, where they correspond to compression settling. Consequently, these PDEs model both PSTs and SSTs.},

The development of a new set of biological (activated sludge, anaerobic digestion), physico-chemical (aqueous phase, precipitation, mass transfer) process models and model interfaces (between water and sludge line) were required to describe the required tri-phasic (gas, liquid, solid) compound transformations and the close interlinks between the P and the sulfur (S) and iron (Fe) cycles. A modified version of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) (open loop) is used as test platform upon which three different operational alternatives (A1, A2, A3) are evaluated. Rigorous sensor and actuator models are also included in order to reproduce realistic control actions. Model-based analysis shows that the combination of an ammonium (SNHX) and total suspended solids (XTSS) control strategy (A1) better adapts the system to influent dynamics, improves phosphate (SPO4) accumulation by phosphorus accumulating organisms (XPAO) (41\%), increases nitrification/denitrification efficiency (18\%) and reduces aeration energy (Eaeration) (21\%). The addition of iron XFeCl3) for chemical P removal (A2) promotes the formation of ferric oxides (XHFO−H, XHFO−L), phosphate adsorption (XHFO−H,P, XHFO−L,P), co-precipitation (XHFO−H,P,old, XHFO−L,P,old) and consequently reduces the P levels in the effluent (from 2.8 to 0.9 g P.m−3). This also has an impact on the sludge line, with hydrogen sulfide production (GH2S) reduced (36\%) due to iron sulfide (XFeS) precipitation. As a consequence, there is also a slightly higher energy production (Eproduction) from biogas. Lastly, the inclusion of a stripping and crystallization unit (A3) for P recovery reduces the quantity of P in the anaerobic digester supernatant returning to the water line and allows potential struvite (XMgNH4PO4) recovery ranging from 69 to 227 kg.day−1depending on: (1) airflow (Qstripping); and, (2) magnesium (QMg(OH)2) addition. All the proposed alternatives are evaluated from an environmental and economical point of view using appropriate performance indices. Finally, some deficiencies and opportunities of the proposed approach when performing (plant-wide) wastewater treatment modelling/engineering projects are discussed.},

  abstract = {A researcher or practitioner can employ a biofilm model to gain insight into what controls the performance of a biofilm process and for optimizing its performance. While a wide range of biofilmmodeling platforms is available, a good strategy is to choose the simplest model that includes sufficient components and processes to address the modeling goal. In most cases, a onedimensional biofilm model provides the best balance, and good choices can range from handcalculation analytical solutions, simple spreadsheets, and numerical-method platforms. What is missing today is clear guidance on how to apply a biofilm model to obtain accurate and meaningful results. Here, we present a five-step framework for good biofilm reactor modeling practice (GBRMP). The first four steps are (1) obtain information on the biofilm reactor system, (2) characterize the influent, (3) choose the plant and biofilm model, and (4) define the conversion processes. Each step demands that the model user understands the important components and processes in the system, one of the main benefits of doing biofilm modeling. The fifth step is to calibrate and validate the model: System-specific model parameters are adjusted within reasonable ranges so that model outputs match actual system performance. Calibration is not a simple 'by the numbers' process, and it requires that the modeler follows a logical hierarchy of steps. Calibration requires that the adjusted parameters remain within realistic ranges and that the calibration process be carried out in an iterative manner. Once each of steps 1 through 5 is completed satisfactorily, the calibrated model can be used for its intended purpose, such as optimizing performance, trouble-shooting poor performance, or gaining deeper understanding of what controls process performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for nonlinear model predictive control based on the concept of passivity. The proposed nonlinear model predictive control scheme is inspired by the relationship between optimal control and passivity as well as by the relationship between optimal control and model predictive control. In particular, a passivity-based state constraint is used to obtain a nonlinear model predictive control scheme with guaranteed closed loop stability. Since passivity and stability are closely related, the proposed approach can be seen as an alternative to control Lyapunov function based approaches. To demonstrate its applicability, the passivity-based nonlinear model predictive control scheme is applied to control a quadruple tank system. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Characterization and modelling of primary settlers have been neglected pretty much to date. However, whole plant and resource recovery modelling requires primary settler model development, as current models lack detail in describing the dynamics and the diversity of the removal process for different particulate fractions. This paper focuses on the improved modelling and experimental characterization of primary settlers. First, a new modelling concept based on particle settling velocity distribution is proposed which is then applied for the development of an improved primary settler model as well as for its characterization under addition of chemicals (chemically enhanced primary treatment, CEPT). This model is compared to two existing simple primary settler models (Otterpohl and Freund; Lessard and Beck), showing to be better than the first one and statistically comparable to the second one, but with easier calibration thanks to the ease with which wastewater characteristics can be translated into model parameters. Second, the changes in the activated sludge model (ASM)-based chemical oxygen demand fractionation between inlet and outlet induced by primary settling is investigated, showing that typical wastewater fractions are modified by primary treatment. As they clearly impact the downstream processes, both model improvements demonstrate the need for more detailed primary settler models in view of whole plant modelling.},

In this paper, a simple primary clarifier model able to take into account the effect of the addition of chemicals on particle settling is presented. Control strategies that optimize the treatment process by chemical addition were designed and tested by running simulations with this CEPT model. The most adequate control strategy in terms of treatment performance, chemicals saving, and maintenance effort was selected. Full-scale implementation of the controller was performed during the autumn of 2015, and the results obtained confirmed the behaviour of the controlled system.

The Priority Research Directions provide a sound basis for a coherent, long-term research and development strategy in SciML and AI. Over the last decade, DOE investments in applied mathematics have laid the groundwork for the type of basic research that will underpin key advances in the six PRDs. Such advances will build on the work from leading researchers in optimization, linear algebra, high-performance solvers and algorithms, multiscale modeling and simulation, complex systems research, uncertainty quantification, and the new basic research areas that will emerge from the pursuit of transformative technologies.},

According to our experience, wastewater treatment plants are indeed looking for ways to successfully integrate their modelling knowledge into their process control structure; however, there are practical aspects of this integration that must be addressed if the benefits of this integration are to be realised.

This should lead to a more realistic test environment and allow control engineers to define the requirements of the measuring equipment as a function of the selected control strategy.},

With the suggested method, it should be possible to detect, isolate, and finally identify systematic measurement errors leading to verified and qualitative data sets. To allow mass balances to be calculated or other reliability checks to be applied, few additional measurements must be introduced in addition to routine measurements. The intensive measurement campaign should be started only after all mass balances applied to the historical data are closed or the faults have been detected, isolated, and identified. In addition to the procedure itself, an overview of typical sources of errors is given.},

  abstract = {Simple data analytics reveal basic insights; more sophisticated analytics, applied to data that has been pooled into a "data lake" with data from external and enterprise sources allows utilities to unearth deeper insights that will help to optimize performance. Because of the growing volume, complexity and strategic importance of asset management data, it is no longer desirable or even feasible for each department/ unit/division/function within a utility to manage this data by itself, or to build its own data analytics capabilities. To get the most out of the new data resources, utilities are creating dedicated data groups that are potentially embedded within the core asset management program team to consolidate data collection, aggregation and analytics. Three trends have emerged in the data management realm-cloud computing, mobile computing, and explosion of data. Utilities are collecting more data than ever before. However, the challenge facing utilities is their inability to convert all the data into meaningful \& usable information. Over the past year, self-service business intelligence tools have provided the necessary capabilities for utility staff to process and analyze data to produce meaningful insights. Advances in technology have revolutionized data and performance reporting so that users (with limited IT development expertise) can perform data mining and develop high impact visuals for performance reporting. Water and Wastewater Utilities are implementing Business Intelligence (BI) frameworks to track and report key asset management performance indicators and other data analytics. Benefits of this business intelligence reporting framework include: 1. Eliminates the reliance on core IT developers to develop and manage reporting frameworks as BI is now integrated with common applications, putting the non-IT user in a position to perform complex data analysis and develop aesthetically-pleasing visualizations 2. Significantly reduces development cost and level of effort 3. Through the concept of data "lakes", data models can be constructed using data from various sources (CMMS, GIS, SCADA, project management, financial and customer information systems) with ease 4. Eliminates the extensive costs and need for complex and disparate system integration that is typically required to connect data for effective performance reporting WEFTEC 2017 WEFTEC 2017 Proceedings Copyright © 2017 Water Environment Federation 4413 5. Reduces the time to develop high impact visualizations to hours or days, rather than weeks, months, and years 6. Complete transferability to mobile devices for use at meetings and workshops This presentation will discuss the utility management business intelligence frameworks that have been implemented by utilities for effective integration, tracking and reporting of various data within their organization. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the value generated by implementing data management and business intelligence through data analytics and how business intelligence aligns with the 3 data trends (cloud, mobile, and explosion of data). INTRODUCTION Data is ubiquitous. More than ever, it is imperative that organizations have the ability to consistently collect, proactively manage, and effectively consume data. Despite the recognition of the massive influx of data and the need to effectively manage it, most organizations are either badly behind the curve or are just getting started. As a response to managing the massive amounts of data, organizations have considered establishing an organizational information strategy within their organizations. Establishing a data management role/s within the organization could be a viable option. However, a clear information strategy alone does not provide the necessary benefits or without a clear strategy to organize and govern any organizations information management systems and data within, the data management role will struggle to pick up any traction. It is evident that no one thing can influence the successful management and consumption of data from multitude of sources. Instead, a combination of activities in tandem can achieve a potential successful outcome.},

A system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) for the bacterial species forming the biofilm, semilinear parabolic (or elliptic) PDEs for the substrates present in the biofilm, and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the motion of the biofilm boundary are obtained. In addition, a further system of parabolic PDEs is added in some situations, such as the invasion of new bacterial species and colonization into an already constituted biofilm. All equations mentioned are mutually connected and must be solved simultaneously in a domain that is a further unknown within the mathematical problem. Transforming the problem to characteristic coordinates yields positive answers about model consistency (uniqueness, existence, positiveness of solutions). The invasion problem is illustrated with some simulations based on the method of characteristics. The biofilm-reactor model is also discussed.},

  abstract = {A fully quantitative cellular automaton (CA) biofilm model was developed. The model describes substrate and biomass as discrete particles existing and interacting in a specified physical domain. Substrate particles move by random walks, simulating molecular diffusion. Microbial particles grow attached to a surface or to other microbial particles, consume substrate particles, and duplicate if a sufficient amount of substrate is consumed. The dynamics of the system are simulated using stochastic processes that represent the occurrence of specific events, such as substrate diffusion, substrate utilization, biofilm growth, and biofilm decay and detachment. The ability of the CA model to predict substrate gradients and fluxes was evaluated by comparing model simulations to predictions from a traditional differential equations model. One and 2D CA models were evaluated. In general, CA model predictions of steady-state flux, biofilm thickness, and substrate gradients inside the biofilm fitted well the differential equations model results; the 2D model had a better agreement at high substrate concentrations. Fully quantitative CA biofilm models offer an alternative approach to simulate biofilm activity and development. Specific advantages of CA modeling include the ability to simulate growth of heterogeneous biofilms with irregular boundary conditions, and the possibility of developing computationally efficient parallel processing algorithms for the quantitative simulation of biofilms in two and three dimensions.},

In this study, quantitative two- and three-dimensional models were evaluated by introducing statistical measures to characterize the complete biofilm structure, both the surface structure and volume structure. The surface enlargement, coefficient of roughness, fractal dimension of surface, biofilm compactness, and solids hold-up were found to be good measures of biofilm structure complexity. Among many possible factors affecting the biofilm structure, the influence of biomass growth in relation to the diffusive substrate transport was investigated. Porous biofilms, with many channels and voids between the 'finger-like' or 'mushroom' outgrowth, were obtained in a substrate- transport-limited regime. Conversely, compact and dense biofilms occurred in systems limited by the biomass growth rate and not by the substrate transfer rate. The surface complexity measures (enlargement, roughness, fractal dimension) all increased with increased transport limitation, whereas the volume measures (compactness, solid hold-up) decreased, showing the change from a compact and dense to a highly porous and open biofilm.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a spatially multidimensional (two-dimensional \{[\}2-D] and three-dimensional \{[\}3-D]) particle-based approach for modeling the dynamics of multispecies biofilms growing on multiple substrates. The model is based on diffusion-reaction mass balances for chemical species coupled with microbial growth and spreading of biomass represented by hard spherical particles. Effectively, this is a scaled-up version of a previously proposed individual-based biofilm model. Predictions of this new particle-based model were quantitatively compared with those obtained with an established one-dimensional (1-D) multispecies model for equivalent problems. A nitrifying biofilm containing aerobic ammonium and nitrite oxidizers, anaerobic ammonium oxidizers, and inert biomass was chosen as an example. The 2-D and 3-D models generally gave the same results. If only the average flux of nutrients needs to be known, 2-D and 1-D models are very similar. However, the behavior of intermediates, which are produced and consumed in different locations within the biofilm, is better described in 2-D and 3-D models because of the multidirectional concentration gradients. The predictions of 2-D or 3-D models are also different from those of 1-D models for slowly growing or minority species in the biofilm. This aspect is related to the mechanism of biomass spreading or advection implemented in the models and should receive more attention in future experimental studies.},

Unlike previous hybrid discrete/continuum models it is a continuum model throughout, describing the interaction of nutrient availability and biomass production. Spatial biomass spreading is described by a nonlinear density-dependent diffusion mechanism. The diffusion operator degenerates for small biomass densities and is singular at the biomass density bound. The model can be interpreted as a predator-prey model for biomass and nutrients. First numerical simulations show that the model is able to predict experimentally observed cluster-and-channel biofilm structures. The results are reliable and in qualitatively good agreement with experimental expectations.},

The model also describes the concentrations of three soluble organic components (soluble substrate and two types of soluble microbial products) and oxygen. The UMCCA model is a hybrid discrete- differential mathematical model and introduces the novel feature of biofilm consolidation. Our hypothesis is that the fluid over the biofilm creates pressures and vibrations that cause the biofilm to consolidate, or pack itself to a higher density over time. Each biofilm compartment in the model output consolidates to a different degree that depends on the age of its biomass. The UMCCA model also adds a cellular automaton algorithm that identifies the path of least resistance and directly moves excess biomass along that path, thereby ensuring that the excess biomass is distributed efficiently. A companion paper illustrates the trends that the UMCCA model is able to represent and shows a comparison with experimental results. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is found that increased biofilm surface roughness means decreased mass conversion in the solid biofilm. Secondly, a correlation between bulk flow Reynolds number and the Sherwood number for mass transfer across the irregular liquid/solid interface is formulated. In a further study the contribution of convective transport to overall mass transfer from bulk liquid into the biofilm was analyzed. The main result was that the experimental observation of high convective flux of solutes in biofilm channels not necessarily is coupled with an equally high net convective contribution to mass transfer from bulk liquid into biofilm.},

  abstract = {In this work, a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical-machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment. Aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Ammonia-based aeration control (ABAC) is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor, which is the conventional aeration control approach. We propose a quantitative stability metric, Total Sample Variance, to compare system-wide variability of competing aeration control strategies. Using this metric, the performance of traditional DO and ABAC control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium-sized WWTP, and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility. To further improve ABAC performance, ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system. Diurnal, diurnal-linear, artificial neural network (ANN), and hybrid diurnal-linear-ANN forecasting models were trained on real-time plant-wide process data. The diurnal-linear and diurnal-linear-ANN forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia; improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32\% and 46\%, respectively, whereas the ANN model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8\%. This work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional WWTP for features in full-scale conventional activated sludge systems.},

  abstract = {Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a useful tool in the fight to track and contain COVID-19 spread within communities. One of the motives behind COVID-19 WBE efforts is the potential for ‘early warning’ of either the onset of disease in a new setting or changes in trends in communities where disease is endemic. Many initial reports of the early warning potential of WBE have relied upon retrospective sample analysis, and delays in WBE analysis and reporting should be considered when evaluating the early warning potential of WBE that enable public health action. Our purpose in this manuscript is to establish a framework to critique the potential of WBE to serve as an early warning system, with special attention to the onset of viral shedding and the differential between results reporting for WBE and clinical testing. While many uncertainties remain regarding both COVID-19 clinical presentation and technical factors influencing WBE results, our analysis suggests at most a modest lead time interval ranging from six days for clinical testing to four days for WBE during community-level wastewater surveillance where clinical testing is accessible on-demand with a rapid time to results. This potential lead time for WBE subsequently increases in settings with limited clinical testing capacity or utilization. Care should be taken when reporting ‘early detection’ of COVID-19 disease trends via WBE to consider underlying causes (e.g., clinical testing lag or delayed result reporting) to avoid misrepresenting WBE potential.},

  abstract = {The "Moore swab" is a classic environmental surveillance tool whereby a gauze pad tied with string is suspended in flowing water or wastewater contaminated with human feces and harboring enteric pathogens that pose a human health threat. In contrast to single volume "grab" samples, Moore swabs act as continuous filters to "trap" microorganisms, which are subsequently isolated and confirmed using appropriate laboratory methods. Continuous filtration is valuable for the isolation of transiently present pathogens such as human-restricted Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A and B. The technique was first proposed (1948) to trace Salmonella Paratyphi B systematically through sewers to pinpoint the residence of a chronic carrier responsible for sporadic outbreaks of paratyphoid fever. From 1948 to 1986, Moore swabs proved instrumental to identify long-term human reservoirs (chronic carriers) and long-cycle environmental transmission pathways of S. Typhi and Paratyphi, for example, to decipher endemic transmission in Santiago, Chile, during the 1980s. Despite limitations such as intermittent shedding of typhoidal Salmonella by humans and the effects of dilution, S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi have been recovered from sewers, surface waters, irrigation canals, storm drains, flush toilets, and septic tanks by using Moore swabs. Driven by the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains that limit treatment options, several countries are embarking on accelerated typhoid control programs using vaccines and environmental interventions. Moore swabs, which are regaining appreciation as important components of the public health/environmental microbiology toolbox, can enhance environmental surveillance for typhoidal Salmonella, thereby contributing to the control of typhoid fever.},

Recent studies have shown that wastewater surveillance can be a low-cost tool for management of COVID-19 pandemic and tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in communities but most studies have been focusing on sampling from wastewater treatment plants. Institutional level of wastewater surveillance may serve well for early warning purposes since cases can be tracked and immediate action can be executed in the event of positive signal. In this study, a novel Moore swab method was developed and used for wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 at institutional level. Among the 219 swab samples tested, 28 (12.8\%) swabs collected from the three campuses and two buildings were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Further individual clinical diagnosis validated the wastewater results and indicated that this method was sensitive enough to detect 1-2 cases in a building. In addition, comparison between grab and Moore swab methods from the hospital sewage line indicated that Moore swab method was more sensitive than the grab sampling method. These results suggest that the Moore swab is a sensitive, practical, and easy to use early warning tool for COVID-19 surveillance especially in low-resource settings and at an early stage of infection in communities..

Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–qPCR) assays are being used by clinical, research and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear whether results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to make independent evaluations of primer–probe sets used in four common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. From our comparisons of RT–qPCR analytical efficiency and sensitivity, we show that all primer–probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 viral RNA copies per reaction. The exception for this is the RdRp-SARSr (Charité) confirmatory primer–probe set which has low sensitivity, probably due to a mismatch to circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the reverse primer. We did not find evidence for background amplification with pre-COVID-19 samples or recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution decreasing sensitivity. Our recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is to select an assay with high sensitivity and that is regionally used, to ease comparability between outcomes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the emerging concept of digital twins (DTs) for urban water systems (UWS) based on the literature, stakeholder interviews and analyzing the current DT implementation process in the utility company VCS Denmark (VCS). Here, DTs for UWS are placed in the context of DTs at the component, unit process/operation or hydraulic structure, treatment plant, system, city, and societal levels. A UWS DT is characterized as a systematic virtual representation of the elements and dynamics of the physical system, organized in a star-structure with a set of features connected by data links that are based on standards for open data. This allows the overall functionality to be broken down into smaller, tangible units (features), enabling microservices that communicate via data links to emerge (the most central feature), facilitated by application programing interfaces (APIs). Coupled to the physical system, simulation models and advanced analytics are among the most important features. We propose distinguishing between living and prototyping DTs, where the term “living” refers to coupling observations from an ever-changing physical twin (which may change with, e.g., urban growth) with a simulation model, through a data link connecting the two. A living DT is thus a near real-time representation of an UWS and can be used for operational and control purposes. A prototyping DT represents a scenario for the system without direct coupling to real-time observations, which can be used for design or planning. By acknowledging that different DTs exist, it is possible to identify the value-creation from DTs achieved by different end-users inside and outside a utility organization. Analyzing the DT workflow in VCS shows that a DT must be multifunctional, updateable, and adjustable to support potential value creation across the utility company. This study helps clarify key DT terminology for UWS and identifies steps to create a DT by building upon digital ecosystems (DEs) and open standards for data.},

  abstract = {Increased availability and affordability of sensors, especially water quality sensors, is poised to improve process control and modelling in water and wastewater systems. Sensor measurements are often flawed by unavoidable influent complexity and sensor instability, making extraction of useful signals problematic. Although a natural reaction is to put extra effort into sensor maintenance to achieve more reliable measurements, useful signals can be extracted from those unqualified signals by appropriate usage of available data-driven tools instructed by physical factors (e.g. prior process knowledge, physical constraints, phenomenal observations). Such methodology is herein defined as hybrid approaches. While the concept of coupling physical factors into data-driven tools is not new in downstream applications such as process modelling and control, little literature has explicitly applied it in the first and equally important step - signal processing. With flawed influent five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) sensor measurements as an example, this paper provides a comprehensive case study demonstrating how physical factors were incorporated throughout the procedures of processing a flawed signal for its maximum value. Results showed that useful signals were extracted and validated via an assembly of well-established machine learning tools, whose performance was improved with physical factors. An Improved Standard Signal Processing Architecture (ISSPA) is also proposed based on the results of this research.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) applies advanced analytical methods to quantify drug residues in wastewater with the aim to estimate illicit drug use at the population level. Transformation processes during transport in sewers (chemical and biological reactors) and storage of wastewater samples before analysis are expected to change concentrations of different drugs to varying degrees. Ignoring transformation for drugs with low to medium stability will lead to an unknown degree of systematic under- or overestimation of drug use, which should be avoided. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge related to the stability of commonly investigated drugs and, furthermore, suggest a more effective approach to future experiments. From over 100 WBE studies, around 50 mentioned the importance of stability and 24 included tests in wastewater. Most focused on in-sample stability (i.e., sample preparation, preservation and storage) and some extrapolated to in-sewer stability (i.e., during transport in real sewers). While consistent results were reported for rather stable compounds (e.g., MDMA and methamphetamine), a varying range of stability under different or similar conditions was observed for other compounds (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine and morphine). Wastewater composition can vary considerably overtime, and different conditions prevail in different sewer systems. In summary, this indicates that more systematic studies are needed to: i) cover the range of possible conditions in sewers and ii) compare results more objectively. To facilitate the latter, we propose a set of parameters that should be reported for in-sewer stability experiments. Finally, a best practice of sample collection, preservation, and preparation before analysis is suggested in order to minimize transformation during these steps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.},

Moreover, population size estimates based on NH4-N loads were lower compared to census data. Diurnal profiles of benzoylecgonine (BE) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC- COOH) were shown to be strongly correlated to NH4-N. Characteristic patterns, which reflect the prolonged nocturnal activity of people during the weekend, could be observed for BE, cocaine, and a major metabolite of MDMA (i.e., 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine). Additional 24 h composite samples were collected between February and September 2013. Per-capita loads (i.e., grams per day per 1000 inhabitants) were computed using census data and NH4-N measurements. Normalization with NH4-N did not modify the overall pattern, suggesting that the magnitude of fluctuations in the size of the population is negligible compared to those of illicit drug loads. Results show that fluctuations in the size of the population over longer periods of time or during major events can be monitored using NH4-N loads: either using raw NH4-N loads or population size estimates based on NH4-N loads, if information about site-specific NH4-N population equivalents is available.},

The decay rates of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and a potential surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), were investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in untreated wastewater, autoclaved wastewater, and dechlorinated tap water stored at 4, 15, 25, and 37 degrees C. Temperature, followed by matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T-90 (time required for 1-log(10) reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T-90 for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37 degrees C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 days in untreated wastewater, 5.58-43.1 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 10.9 to 43.9 days in tap water. There was no statistically significant difference between RNA decay of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV; thus, MHV is suggested as a suitable persistence surrogate. Decay rate constants for all temperatures were comparable across all matrices for both viral RNAs, except in untreated wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, which showed less sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for WBE application.},

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations.    An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.},

Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.},

  abstract = {There is currently a clear benefit for many countries to utilize wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as part of ongoing measures to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A-C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D-E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the recovery efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7\%. The most efficient methods were adsorption-extraction methods with MgCl2 pre-treatment (Method C), and without pre-treatment (Method B). The third most efficient method used the Amicon (R) Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Method D) and its recovery efficiency was not statistically different from the most efficient methods. The methods with the worst recovery efficiency included the adsorption-extraction method with acidification (A). followed by PEG precipitation (F). Our results suggest that absorption-extraction methods with minimal or without pre-treatment can provide suitably rapid, cost-effective and relatively straightforward recovery of enveloped viruses in wastewater. The MHV is a promising process control for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and can be used as a quality control measure to support community-level epidemic mitigation and risk assessment.

  abstract = {To which extent illicit drugs are transformed during in-sewer transport, depends on a number of factors: i) substance-specific transformation rates, ii) environmental conditions, iii) point of discharge (location of drug user) and iv) sewer network properties, primarily hydraulic residence time (HRT) and the ratio of biofilm contact area to wastewater volume (A/V-eq).    Assessing associated uncertainties typically requires numerous simulations. Therefore, we propose a new two-step modeling framework: 1) Quantify hydrodynamic conditions. This computationally demanding step was performed once in SWMM to derive HRT and A/V-eq for each potential point of discharge (node) in three catchments of different size. 2) Estimate biomarker loss. In this step, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for defined scenarios. Depending on assumptions about drug user distribution and prevalence, a number of nodes was sampled. For each node an empirical first-order transformation model was applied with flow-path-corresponding HRT and A/V-eq from step 1. Biotic and abiotic transformation rates were sampled from distributions combining variability of different biofilms.    In our modeling study, median losses were {$>$}30\% for amphetamine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and 6-acetylcodeine in all three catchments with high uncertainty (5\%-100\% loss), which would imply a systematic underestimation of consumption when neglecting in-sewer processes. Median losses for 21 other investigated biomarkers were {$<$}10\% with different uncertainty ranges - "no substantial transformation" was confirmed for nine substances in a real sewer segment with a 2-h residence time. Transferability of these results must be tested for other catchments. To further reduce uncertainty, mainly additional knowledge on transformation rates, particularly in biofilm, and their distribution across a sewer network is needed to update model input objectively. Our approach allows efficient testing and, furthermore, can be expanded for many other human biomarkers. Accounting for biomarker stability during in-sewer transport will avoid biased estimates and further improve wastewater-based epidemiology. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The last 17 years have seen three major outbreaks caused by coronaviruses, with the latest outbreak, COVID-19, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater.    This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of diarrhoea caused by gastrointestinal infections. We also reviewed the literature on the presence, survival and potential removal of coronaviruses in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, highlighted the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks.    The mortalities and morbidities associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission. The current wealth of knowledge on coronaviruses in wastewater based on the reviewed literature is scant and therefore calls for further studies.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spread rapidly across the globe infecting millions of people and causing significant health and economic impacts. Authorities are exploring complimentary approaches to monitor this infectious disease at the community level. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal wastewater are being implemented worldwide as an environmental surveillance approach to inform health authority decision-making. Owing to the extended excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool, WBE can surveil large populated areas with a longer detection window providing unique information on the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that are unlikely to be screened by clinical testing. Herein, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 24-h composite wastewater samples (n = 63) from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia from 24th of February to 1st of May 2020. A total of 21 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 135 to 11,992 gene copies (GC)/100 mL of wastewater. Detections were made in a Southern Brisbane WWTP in late February 2020, up to three weeks before the first clininal case was reported there. Wastewater samples were generally positive during the period with highest caseload data. The positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater while there were limited clinical reported cases demonstrates the potential of WBE as an early warning system to identify hotspots and target localised public health responses, such as increased individual testing and the provision of health warnings.

  abstract = {Understanding the actual consumption of alcohol and tobacco in the population is important for forming public health policy. For this purpose, wastewater-based epidemiology has been applied as a complementary method to estimate the overall alcohol and tobacco consumption in different communities. However, the stability of their consumption biomarkers - ethyl sulfate, ethyl glucuronide, cotinine, and trans-3-hydroxycotinine - in the sewer system has not yet been assessed. This study aimed to conduct such assessment using sewer reactors mimicking conditions of rising main, gravity sewer, and wastewater alone, over a 12-hour period. The results show that cotinine and trans-3-hydroxycotinine are relatively stable under all sewer conditions while ethyl sulfate was only stable in wastewater alone and gradually degraded in rising main and gravity sewer conditions. Ethyl glucuronide quickly degraded in all reactors. These findings suggest that cotinine and trans-3-hydroxycotinine are good biomarkers to estimate tobacco consumption; ethyl sulfate may be used as a biomarker to estimate alcohol consumption, but its in-sewer loss should be accounted for in the calculation of consumption estimates. Ethyl glucuronide, and probably most of glucuronide compounds, are not suitable biomarkers to be used in wastewater-based epidemiology due to their in-sewer instability.},

Influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from 49 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 24 major cities that cover all the geographic regions of the country. Concentrations of morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, and codeine were measured. Near complete removal of morphine by wastewater treatment processes was observed, whereas removal rates of codeine were slightly lower. Morphine loads were much higher than codeine loads at most WWTPs in China, a trend opposite to that in many European countries. In addition, morphine and codeine loads were strongly correlated at most WWTPs, indicating morphine and codeine in wastewater were predominantly from the same source, street heroin. At WWTPs in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, codeine loads were considerably higher than morphine loads, consistent with previous reports of codeine abuse (e.g., as cough syrup) among middle and high school students in Guangdong province. Heroin consumption was derived based on morphine loads and taking into account therapeutic use of morphine and codeine, as well as contribution of codeine and acetylcodeine in street heroin. Highest heroin consumption was observed in northwestern and southwestern China. The average heroin consumption of the sampled cities was 64.6 +/- 78.7 mg/1000 inh/d. The nation-wide average heroin consumption was much lower than that of methamphetamine, consistent with seizure data and numbers of registered heroin and methamphetamine users in China.

  abstract = {Transformation of biomarkers (or their stability) during sewer transport is an important issue for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Most studies so far have been conducted in the laboratory, which usually employed unrealistic conditions. In the present study, we utilized a pilot sewer system including a gravity pipe and a rising main pipe to investigate the fate of 24 pharmaceutical biomarkers. A programmable logic controller was used to control and monitor the system including sewer operational conditions and wastewater properties. Sequential samples were collected that can represent hydraulic retention time (HRT) of up to 8 h in a rising main and 4 h in a gravity sewer. Wastewater parameters and biomarker concentrations were analysed to evaluate the stability and transformation kinetics. The wastewater parameters of the pilot system were close to the conditions of real sewers. The findings of biomarker transformation were also close to real sewer data with seventeen biomarkers reported as stable while buprenorphine, caffeine, ethyl-sulfate, methadone, paracetamol, paraxanthine and salicylic acid degraded to variable extents. Both zero-order and first-order kinetics were used to model the degradation of unstable biomarkers and interestingly the goodness of fit R-2 for the zero-order model was higher than the first-order model for all unstable biomarkers in the rising main. The pilot sewer system simulates more realistic conditions than benchtop laboratory setups and may provide a more accurate approach for assessing the in-sewer transformation kinetics and stability of biomarkers.

However, the lack of information on potential transformation of biomarkers in the sewer system can compromise the accuracy of the consumption estimation. The present study contributes to addressing this issue by investigating the in-sewer stability of biomarkers from a number of commonly used drugs using laboratory sewer reactors that canmimic different sewer conditions. A stable and an unstable chemical (carbamazepine and caffeine) were also used as benchmarking chemicals to reflect the chemical degradation potential in different sewer conditions. The results suggested that ketamine and norketamine were unstable in gravity and rising main sewers, ketamine was unstable in bulk liquid while norketamine was stable under the same condition. Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the rising main sewer. Morphine and codeine glucuronide were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties.

Human biomonitoring (HBM) studies, foodstuff analysis and dietary surveys are usually used to assess human exposure, but they are costly and time-consuming. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can complement the established exposure monitoring tools. The aim of this study was to develop a new WBE application for assessing human exposure to mycotoxins by measuring specific biomarkers in raw wastewater. Eleven substances were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in wastewater from four cities in Italy and Spain. Only deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisines were found, DON being the most abundant, in accordance with HBM studies. DON intake, back-calculated by WBE, was lower than the established Health-Based Guidance values, indicating moderate exposure in the population, with no risks for human health. WBE intake estimates were very close to those reported in HBM studies, validating WBE for estimating DON intake in the population. This study describes a promising WBE approach to complement HBM studies and assess the human intake of specific classes of mycotoxins, thus helping to identify risks for human health.},

The SARS-CoV-2 virus not only affects the human respiratory system, but also the gastrointestinal tract. The virus has been found in human feces, in sewage and in wastewater treatment plants. It has the potential to become a panzootic disease, as it is now proven that several mammalian species become infected. Since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population, Wastewater Based Epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second, or subsequent, wave. To prevent a panzootic, virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment. In that context, this review presents recent improvements in all the fields of wastewater treatment from treatment ponds to the use of algae or nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on membrane-based techniques.},

A lack of effective methods for screening potential patients, rapidly diagnosing suspected cases, and accurately monitoring of the epidemic in real time to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 raises significant difficulties in mitigating the epidemic in many countries. As effective point-of-care diagnosis tools, simple, low-cost and rapid sensors have the potential to greatly accelerate the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients to improve their treatment and care. In particular, there is evidence that multiple pathogens have been detected in sewage, including SARS-CoV-2, providing significant opportunities for the development of advanced sensors for wastewater-based epidemiology that provide an early warning of the pandemic within the population. Sensors could be used to screen potential carriers, provide real-time monitoring and control of the epidemic, and even support targeted drug screening and delivery within the integration of emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology. In this communication, we discuss the feasibility of an integrated point-of-care biosensor system with mobile health for wastewater-based epidemiology (iBMW) for early warning of COVID-19, screening and diagnosis of potential infectors, and improving health care and public health. The iBMW will provide an effective approach to prevent, evaluate and intervene in a fast, affordable and reliable way, thus enabling real-time guidance for the government in providing effective intervention and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention.},

Since surveys on substance use may be difficult due to response biases, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was developed as a more objective measure of nicotine and alcohol use. This study compares estimates of nicotine and alcohol use from a wastewater sampling campaign in a medium-sized Belgian city with a concurrently executed population survey.    Methods: 29,083 letters about participation in an online survey study on weekly alcohol and tobacco use were sent to the inhabitants of Lier, Belgium. Wastewater samples were collected from the associated treatment plant in four bi-weekly periods. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Ethylsulfate was used as alcohol biomarker and cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine as nicotine biomarker.    Results: 263 (1\%) surveys were filled out on average per week. According to survey data, alcohol and nicotine were used less than in the rest of Belgium and this was matched by the wastewater data. Nicotine use, but not alcohol use, showed a significant variation over the sampling periods. Both nicotine and alcohol showed increase use during the weekend while only alcohol showed a different use pattern throughout the week.    Conclusion: No correlation between WBE and survey data could be demonstrated, possibly due to small sample sizes. However, this study shows that weekly trends in alcohol and nicotine use can be quickly detected from wastewater analysis and the occurrence of major events such as festivals can be identified.

The disease is now a global pandemic and is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 by international bodies. Important viral transmission sources include human contact, respiratory droplets and aerosols, and through contact with contaminated objects. However, viral shedding in feces and urine by COVID-19-afflicted patients raises concerns about SARS-CoV-2 entering aquatic systems. Recently, targeted SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments have been successfully detected in wastewater, sewage sludge and river waters around the world. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies can provide early detection and assessment of COVID-19 transmission and the growth of active cases within given wastewater catchment areas. WBE surveillance's ability to detect the growth of cases was demonstrated. Was this science applied throughout the world as this pandemic spread throughout the globe? Wastewater treatment efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 removal and risk assessments associated with treated water are reported. Disinfection strategies using chemical disinfectants, heat and radiation for deactivating and destroying SARS-CoV-2 are explained. Analytical methods of SARS-CoV-2 detection are covered. This review provides a more complete overview of the present status of SARS-CoV-2 and its consequences in aquatic systems. So far, WBE programs have not yet served to provide the early alerts to authorities that they have the potential to achieve.

The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission. This case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm. Overall, WBE proved to be an accurate diagnostic for new cases of COVID-19 with an 82.0\% positive predictive value and an 88.9\% negative predictive value. Increases in positive wastewater samples and clinical tests were noted following holiday-related activities. However, shelter-in-place policies proved to be effective in reducing the number of daily reported positive wastewater and clinical tests.

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is increasingly being incorporated into public health efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts, approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid, sensitive, and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters. In this study, we present an ultracentrifugation-based method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA and use crAssphage, a bacteriophage specific to the human gut, to help account for RNA loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing. With these methods, we were able to detect, and sometimes quantify, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 mL wastewater samples within as little as 4.5 hours. Using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus RNA and deactivated SARS-CoV-2, we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7-12\% of viral RNA using our method. Results from 24 sewersheds across Upstate New York during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater may be indicative of greater COVID-19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10,000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1.7\%. crAssphage DNA concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied. After accounting for flow rate and population served, crAssphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1.35 x 10(11) and 2.42 x 10(8) genome copies per day for DNA and RNA, respectively. A negative relationship between per capita crAssphage RNA and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of RNA over long transit times. Our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crAssphage co-detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data.

  abstract = {The current pandemic disease coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only become a worldwide health emergency, but also devoured the global economy. Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARSCoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.    (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is one of the most promising approaches to effectively monitor the spread of COVID-19. The virus concentration in faeces and its temporal variations are essential information for WBE. While some clinical studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in faeces, the value varies amongst patients and changes over time. The present study aimed to examine how the temporal variations in the concentration of virus in faeces affect the monitoring of disease incidence. We reanalysed the experimental findings of clinical studies to estimate the duration of virus shedding and the faecal virus concentration. Available experimental data as of 23 October 2020 were collected. The viral shedding kinetics was modelled, and the dynamic model was fitted to the collected data by a Bayesian framework. Using posterior distributions, the duration of viral shedding and the concentration of virus copies in faeces over time were computed. We estimated the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces as 3.4 (95\% CrI: 024-6.5) log copies per gram-faeces over the shedding period, and our model implied that the duration of viral shedding was 26.0 days (95\% CrI: 21.7-34.9), given the current standard quantification limit (Ct = 40). With simulated incidences, our results also indicated that a one-week delay between symptom onset and wastewater sampling increased the estimation of incidence by a factor of 172 (i.e., 10(1.24) times higher). Our results demonstrated that the temporal variation in virus concentration in faeces affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE. The present study also implied the need for adjusting the estimates of virus concentration in faeces by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved concentrations. The method used in this study is easily implemented in further simulations; therefore, the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease surveillance and risk assessments that require quantities of virus to be excreted into the environment.

This study aimed to review and estimate the CFs for atenolol, carbamazepine, and naproxen for WBE using the daily mass loads of those pharmaceuticals in wastewater and their corresponding dispensed prescription data in Australia. Influent wastewater samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants serving approximately 24\% of the Australian population and annual national dispensed prescription data. The estimated CFs for atenolol and carbamazepine are 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.17-1.66) and 8.69 (95\% CI: 7.66-10.03), respectively. Due to significant over-the-counter sales of naproxen, a reliable CF could not be estimated based on prescription statistics. Using an independent dataset of 186 and 149 wastewater samples collected in an urban catchment in 2011 and 2012, WBE results calculated using the new CFs matched well with the dispensed data for atenolol and carbamazepine in the catchment area.},

  abstract = {Modeling and prediction of a city's (Oslo, Norway) daily dynamic population using mobile device-based population activity data and three low cost markers is presented for the first time. Such data is useful for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which is an approach used to estimate the population level use of licit and illicit drugs, new psychoactive substances, human exposure to a wide range of pollutants, such as pesticides or phthalates, as well as the release of endogenous substances such as oxidative stress- and allergen biomarkers. Comparing WBE results between cities often requires normalization to population size, and inaccuracy in the measured population can introduce high levels of uncertainty. In this study mobile phone data from 8-weeks in 2016 was used to train three linear models based on drinking water production, electricity consumption and online measurements of ammonium in wastewater. The ammonium model showed the best correlation with R-2 = 0.88 while drinking water production and electricity consumption showed more discrepancies. The three models were then re-evaluated against 5-week of mobile phone data from 2017 showing mean absolute errors {$<$}10\%. The ammonium-based estimated mean annual population for Oslo in 2017 was 645 000 inhabitants, 4\% higher than the "de jure" population reported by the wastewater treatment plant. Due to changing conditions and seasonality, drinking water production underestimated the population by 27\% and electricity consumption overestimated the population by 59\%. Therefore, the results of this work showed that the ammonium mass loads can be used as an anthropogenic proxy to monitor and correct the fluctuations in population for a specific catchment area. Furthermore, this approach uses a simple, yet reliable indicator for population size that can be used also in other areas of research.},

Facing the unprecedented global public health crisis caused by COVID-19, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been given high expectations as a promising surveillance complement to clinical testing which had been plagued by limited capacity and turnaround time. In particular, recent studies have highlighted the role WBE may play in being a part of the early warning system. In this study, we briefly discussed the basics of the concept, the benefits and critical points of such an application, the challenges faced by the scientific community, the progress made so far, and what awaits to be addressed by future studies to make the concept work. We identified that the shedding dynamics of infected individuals, especially in the form of a mathematical shedding model, and the back-calculation of the number of active shedders from observed viral load are the major bottlenecks of WBE application in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserve more attention, and the sampling strategy (location, timing, and interval) needs to be optimized to fit the purpose and scope of the WBE project.

A new bioanalytical method was developed, optimised and validated for the analysis of a broad range of antidepressants and their metabolites at trace concentrations in influent wastewater. The assay was based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. For most compounds, Oasis (R) HLB cartridges were used for sample preparation. Oasis (R) MCX cartridges were used for extraction of normirtazapine, moclobemide, sertraline, and melitracen in particular. The Kinetex XBC18 column with a gradient elution resulted in appropriate separation for the analytes under investigation. Validation was done according to the European Medicines Agency guidelines on bioanalytical method validation. For 27 compounds, the performance criteria met the requirements for method validation. For these analytes, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) ranged between 1 and 25 ng/L. Furthermore, all targeted biomarkers showed high in-sample stability during 24 h, with the exception of mianserin. The validated assay was applied to influent wastewater samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Belgium. Among these four locations, a total of 18 out of 27 biomarkers for antidepressant use were present in the samples in concentrations above the LLOQ. Additionally, the proposed methodology proved capable of analysing high resolution spatio-temporal trends. Mann-Kendall trend analyses showed that antidepressant use is stable throughout the week, except for trazodone which increased throughout the week.},

Rapid progress has been made in addressing the situation, and various clinical diagnostic methods were developed for early detection of transmission. However, with a rapidly increasing number of infected populations worldwide, the testing of each individual was impractical. The wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been implemented to evaluate disease outbreaks as an early warning system for pandemic preparedness. Numerous studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the open drains and STPs across the globe via recovery efficiency of surrogate virus from existing virus concentration protocols. However, the such reported studies did not justify the use of WBE to identify or pinpoint the specific hotspots of transmission which could be prioritized for rapid efforts to contain or accelerate active vaccination efforts. Identifying precise locations of hotspots could be an essential aspect in controlling the outbreak and surge of wave by prioritizing the region for primary outbreak response. This article focuses on the issues relating to the primary focus for WBE that can be adapted, and its suitability for utilization in the mass vaccination program is discussed. Effective use of WBE information in terms of source tracking might be crucial as we move towards mass vaccination to control outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemic.},

Wastewater-based epidemiology has the advantages of being inexpensive and yielding more consistent and near real-time results.

Wastewater monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent responsible for COVID-19, has emerged as a promising tool for health officials to an-ticipate outbreaks. As interest in wastewater monitoring continues to grow and municipalities begin to implement this approach, there is a need to further identify and evaluate methods used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA from wastewater samples. Here we evaluate the recovery, cost, and throughput of five different concentration methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in wastewater samples. We tested the five methods on six different wastewater samples. We also evaluated the use of a bovine coronavirus vaccine as a process control and pepper mild mottle virus as a normalization factor. Of the five methods we tested head-to-head, we found that HA filtration with bead beating performed the best in terms of sensitivity and cost. This evaluation can serve as a guide for laboratories establishing a protocol to perform wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Rapid development of WBE requires rapid and on-site analytical tools for monitoring of sewage biomarkers to provide immediate decision and intervention. Biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response, ease-to-use, low cost and the potential for field testing. This paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via WBE.

Finally, we provide a perspective on the future use of the biosensor technology for WBE to enable rapid on-site monitoring of sewage, which will provide nearly real-time data for public health assessment and effective intervention.

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WEE), the per capita normalised measurement of drugs, chemicals or metabolites in wastewater influent, relies on sampling and quantitative analysis to evaluate temporal and spatial trends of chemical consumption. Continuous, high-resolution, flow proportional composite sampling is optimal for accurate representations of chemical mass loads, but is rarely implemented, with conventional autosamplers providing relatively low frequency time or volume proportional samples. However, due to equipment or resource constraints at many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), even this may not be feasible. Passive sampling may provide an alternative sampling strategy. To investigate this, samplers comprising hollow, cylindrical Microporous Polyethylene Tubes (MPTs) containing polymeric sorbent phases of Strata-X and Strata-X in agarose were simultaneously deployed in a municipal WWTP influent stream. Samplers were extracted, analysed and evaluated for a range of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) after 4, 7, 15, 21, and 29 day deployments. The MPT samplers were calibrated against 24-hour time proportional composite grab samples that were collected in parallel. Diffusion through the MPT governed uptake, reducing or eliminating the influence of external flow rates that may fluctuate unpredictably in a WWTP environment. Calibration data for six illicit drugs and fourteen PPCPs, including methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, MDMA, codeine and carbamazepine, demonstrated linear accumulation in the samplers (R-2 {$>$}= 0.84). Derived sampling rates for these analytes ranged from 025 to 17 mL d(-1) for ibuprofen and verapamil, respectively. A validation study using this sampling rate data showed the MPT could effectively quantify concentrations ({$>$}= 0.1 ng mL(-1)) of a range of amphetamine- type stimulants, opioids and metabolites as well as nicotine, accounting for 95\% of the variance in parallel composite grab sample concentrations of these compounds. The MPT sampler shows promise for providing essential monitoring data for WBE, informing future intervention and research strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater can provide unique information on the incidence or prevalence of COVID-19 in community. However, there are several technical challenges coupled with sewage sampling for SARS-CoV-2, including intermittent shedding of viruses, sampling time, volume, and frequency. Sampling schemes thus may need to be tailored to reach out highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable results. Herein, we compared the accuracy and threshold cycle (Ct) profiles of SARS-CoV-2 in Moore swabs, composite (16-h), and grab samples taken from sewage manholes (n = 17) at the Middle Eastern city of Tehran, Iran, on two occasions (November 2020 and May 2021). Samples were concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and the corresponding Ct values for CDC \& lsquo;N \& rsquo; and \& lsquo;ORF1ab \& rsquo; assays were derived by means of real time RT-qPCR. Overall, the Moore swabs performed equal to samples composited over 16 h for qualitative monitoring, and 34/34 (100\%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The \& lsquo;N \& rsquo; assay showed the highest detection frequency as compared to \& lsquo;ORF1ab \& rsquo;. The mean Moore swab Ct profiles were more consistent with 16 h composite sampling as compared with corresponding grab samples, providing hints as to the best sampling protocol to adopt when planning a sewage monitoring campaign particularly under WBE. Furthermore, our analyses on local differences showed somewhat higher virus copy numbers in the southern areas. The experimental design of this study revealed that the Moore swab and composite samples are more sensitive than grab samples, suggesting that the collection of grab samples may be inappropriate for characterizing total number of viral RNA copies in sewage samples. Given the transiently presence of human host-restricted infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and the simplicity and affordability of Moore swab, the method is well suited for disease surveillance in resource poor regions struggling with limited capacity for clinical testing.

  abstract = {Endogenous chemicals specific to human metabolism have been suggested to be good candidates for markers of population size in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). So far, creatinine is the only endogenous chemical to be assessed against the criteria of in-sewer stability. This study thus aimed to evaluate the fate of three other endogenous compounds, 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), cortisol and androstenedione, under different sewer conditions using laboratory-scale sewer reactors. The results showed that while all compounds were stable in wastewater only (i.e. without biofilm), cortisol and androstenedione degraded quickly in sewers with the presence of sewer biofilms. The degradation followed first-order kinetics similar to that of creatinine. In contrast, 5-HIAA was relatively stable in sewer reactors. This study also recognised the impact of wastewater pH on the detectability of 5-HIAA using a LC-MS/MS direct injection method. In samples acidified to pH 2, the method did not allow routine detection/quantification of 5-HIAA whereas in non-acidified samples the method was sufficiently sensitive for routine quantification of 5-HIAA. The stability of 5-HIAA in sewers and the possibility to measure it using a simple and rapid analytical method corroborate that 5-HIAA may be a suitable biomarker for estimation of population size in WBE.

  abstract = {Wastewater based epidemiology is a potential early warning tool for the detection of COVID-19 outbreak. Sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was introduced in Hungary after the successful containment of the first wave of the pandemic to forecast the resurge of infections. Three wastewater treatment plants servicing the entire population (1.8 million) of the capital, Budapest were sampled weekly. 24 h composite (n = 44) and grab samples (n = 21) were concentrated by an in-house flat sheet membrane ultrafiltration method. The efficiency and reproducibility of the method was comparable to those previously published. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified using RT-qPCR of the N gene. The first positive signal in sewage was detected 2 weeks before the rise in case numbers. Viral concentration and volume-adjusted viral load correlated to the weekly new cases from the same week and the rolling 7-day average of active cases in the subsequent week. The correlation was more pronounced in the ascending phase of the outbreak, data was divergent once case numbers plateaued. Wastewater surveillance was found to be effective in predicting the second wave of the outbreak in Hungary. Data indicated that even relatively low frequency (weekly) sampling is useful and at the same time, cost effective tool in outbreak detection.    (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An important uncertainty in population normalized loads generated is related to the size and variability of the actual population served by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Here, we built a population model using location-based services (LBS) data to estimate dynamic consumption of illicit drugs. First, the LBS data from Tencent Location Big Data and resident population were used to train a linear population model for estimating population (r(2) = 0.92). Then, the spatiotemporal accuracy of the population model was validated. In terms of temporal accuracy, we compared the model-based population with the time-aligned ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) population within the WWTP of SEG, showing a mean squared error of {$<$} 10\%. In terms of spatial accuracy, we estimated the model-based population of 42 WWTPs in Dalian and compared it with the NH4-N and design population, indicating good consistency overall (5\% less than NH4-N and 4\% less than design). Furthermore, methamphetamine consumption and prevalence based on the model were calculated with an average of 111 mg/day/1000 inhabitants and 0.24\%, respectively, and dynamically displayed on a visualization system for real-time monitoring. Our study provided a dynamic and accurate population for estimating the population-level use of illicit drugs, much improving the temporal and spatial trend analysis of drug use. Furthermore, accurate information on drug use could be used to assess population health risks in a community.},

During periods with high test positivity rates, however, case numbers may be underreported, whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation. Here we investigated how the dynamics of new COVID-19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true COVID-19 incidence dynamics. We focused on the first pandemic wave in Switzerland (February to April, 2020), when test positivity ranged up to 26\%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were determined 2-4 times per week in three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (Lugano, Lausanne and Zurich). Wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection-to-case confirmation delay distribution, respectively, to estimate infection incidence dynamics. Finally, the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model. Incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases. In contrast, case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections. Under a regime of high-test positivity rates, WBE thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Humans are nowadays exposed to numerous chemicals in our day-to-day life, including parabens, UV filters, phosphorous flame retardants/plasticizers, bisphenols, phthalates and alternative plasticizers, which can have different adverse effects to human health. Estimating human's exposure to these potentially harmful substances is, therefore, of paramount importance. Human biomonitoring (HBM) is the existing approach to assess exposure to environmental contaminants, which relies on the analysis of specific human biomarkers (parent compounds and/or their metabolic products) in biological matrices from individuals. The main drawback is its implementation, which involves complex cohort studies. A novel approach, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), involves estimating exposure from the analysis of biomarkers in sewage (a pooled urine and feces sample of an entire population). One of the key challenges of WBE is the selection of biomarkers which are specific to human metabolism, excreted in sufficient amounts, and stable in sewage. So far, literature data on potential biomarkers for estimating exposure to these chemicals are scattered over numerous pharmacokinetic and HBM studies. Hence, this review provides a list of potential biomarkers of exposure to more than 30 widely used chemicals and report on their urinary excretion rates. Furthermore, the potential and challenges of WBE in this particular field is discussed through the review of pioneer WBE studies, which for the first time explored applicability of this novel approach to assess human exposure to environmental contaminants. In the future, WBE could be potentially applied as an "early warning system", which could promptly identify communities with the highest exposure to environmental contaminants. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Currently, the whole world is fighting against this pandemic that is transmitted either through exposure to virus laden respiratory or water droplets or by touching the virus contaminated surfaces. The viral load in feces of an infected patient varies according to the severity of the disease. Subsequent detection of viral genome (SARS-CoV-2) in human feces and sewage systems is an emerging concern for public health. This also dictates to reinforce the existing sewage/wastewater treatment facilities. Rapid monitoring is the key to prevent and control the current mass transmission. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a potential epidemiology tool that can act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. In a developing country like India, inadequate wastewater treatment systems, low-operational facility and relaxed surface water quality criteria even in terms of fecal coliform bacteria are the major challenges for WBE. Herein, we review the occurrence, transmission, and survival of SARS-CoV-2, and disinfection and potential of sewage surveillance as an early warning system for COVID-19 spread. We also discuss the challenges of open-defecation practices affecting sewage-surveillance in real-time in densely populated developing countries like India.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was investigated and was compared with the number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study area during COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to {$>$}20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture; however, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected at a low frequency even when the number was below 1.0. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be detected in the early stage of the epidemic, even if the number of confirmed cases potentially underestimates the actual numbers of cases. This suggests that WBE approach can potentially act as an early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US\$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.

The analysis of samples from the NW region of Spain showed that these substances occur in raw wastewater up to ca. 1.6 mu g L-1 and in treated wastewater up to ca. 1 mu g L-1 Concentrations in raw wastewater were converted into levels of exposure to six phthalate diesters. For two of them, these levels were always below the daily exposure thresholds recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Food Safety Authority. For the other four, however, estimates of exposure surpassed such a threshold (especially the toddler threshold) in some cases, highlighting the significance of the exposure to phthalates in children.

A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating the number of people present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31\%. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55\% in static normalized data. Mobile device-based population activity patterns allow for dynamic normalization that yields much improved temporal and spatial trend analysis.},

The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlated positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinically confirmed case counts in the sewershed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers.

  abstract = {Human biomonitoring, i.e. the determination of chemicals and/or their metabolites in human specimens, is the most common and potent tool for assessing human exposure to pesticides, but it suffers from limitations such as high costs and biases in sampling. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an innovative approach based on the chemical analysis of specific human metabolic excretion products (biomarkers) in wastewater, and provides objective and real-time information on xenobiotics directly or indirectly ingested by a population. This study applied the WBE approach for the first time to evaluate human exposure to pesticides in eight cities across Europe. 24 h-composite wastewater samples were collected from the main wastewater treatment plants and analyzed for urinary metabolites of three classes of pesticides, namely triazines, organophosphates and pyrethroids, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mass loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) were highest for organophosphates and lowest for triazines. Different patterns were observed among the cities and for the various classes of pesticides. Population weighted loads of specific biomarkers indicated higher exposure in Castellon, Milan, Copenhagen and Bristol for pyrethroids, and in Castellon, Bristol and Zurich for organophosphates. The lowest mass loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) were found in Utrecht and Oslo. These results were in agreement with several national statistics related to pesticides exposure such as pesticides sales. The daily intake of pyrethroids was estimated in each city and it was found to exceed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) only in one city (Castellon, Spain). This was the first large-scale application of WBE to monitor population exposure to pesticides. The results indicated that WBE can give new information about the ``average exposure'' of the population to pesticides, and is a useful complementary biomonitoring tool to study population-wide exposure to pesticides.

  abstract = {Background: Estimations of drug use are mostly based on population surveys that can suffer from response biases. The current study evaluates using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for assessing illicit drug use by comparing wastewater data with that from a population survey. Methods: Introductory letters (29,083) were sent to inhabitants of Lier, Belgium, asking them to participate in an online survey study. Participants were asked to indicate their drug use in the past week for a 12-week period (September-November 2014). Concomitant wastewater samples were collected from the associated wastewater treatment plant in four bi-weekly periods. Samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: On average, 263 (1\%) inhabitants filled out the questionnaire each week. According to the survey results, cannabis was the most used drug, followed by amphetamine, cocaine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Wastewater data corroborated these results. Cocaine, amphetamine and MDMA showed a significant difference between days of the week. The four sampling periods differed significantly from each other for cocaine, amphetamine and methadone. Conclusion: Observed drug consumption patterns from survey and wastewater data match national and international data. Wastewater analyses confirm that WBE can be reliably used to confirm patterns and trends in drug use. Future studies should focus on identifying the most opportune sampling period giving the most reliable estimates of drug use and use smaller, contained communities such as festivals or prisons if methodology allows. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This long tracking period allowed a better understanding of the patterns affecting the occurrence of this type of contaminants. Among them, 2 were never detected (i.e. heroin and amphetamine). Concerning illicit drugs two patterns were found. Cocaine and ecstasy median loads varied considerably between weekdays and weekend days (i.e. 18.3 and 35.9\% respectively) whereas cannabis and heroin (based on 6-mono-acetylmorphine loads) loads were within the same order of magnitude with a significant statistical correlation with pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen or ketoprofen. The consumption of selected drugs was back-calculated from the loads. Among illicit drugs the highest consumption was found for cannabis with a median consumption of 51mg . day(-1) . inhabitant(-1) (inh) whereas the median consumption for cocaine (based on benzoylecgonine loads) and ecstasy was 32 and 6 mg . day(-1) . 10(3) . inh(-1) respectively. The highest consumption values of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) were found for acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acidwith 108.8 and 34.1 mg . day(-1) . inh(-1) respectively, in good agreementwith national sales data. A statistically significant weekly pattern was found for several PACs such as metoprolol and trimethoprim, but with the opposite pattern to that of illicit drugs. The variations in daily PAC loads could provide information about themobility of people in the catchment, especially on the basis of daily taken PACs (i.e. to treat chronicle diseases).

Literature results have been shown the potential of WBE as an innovative tool to monitor viral spread in large communities, map contagion curves and hotspots, identify the contribution of asymptomatic individuals, and subsidize early warning systems for disease outbreaks. WBE can offer less expensive responses for monitoring large populations compared to individual clinical tests which are not feasible on large scales.

  abstract = {Background Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a new methodology for estimating the drug load in a population. Simple summary statistics and specification tests have typically been used to analyze WBE data, comparing differences between weekday and weekend loads. Such standard statistical methods may, however, overlook important nuanced information in the data. In this study, we apply functional data analysis (FDA) to WBE data and compare the results to those obtained from more traditional summary measures. Methods We analysed temporal WBE data from 42 European cities, using sewage samples collected daily for one week in March 2013. For each city, the main temporal features of two selected drugs were extracted using functional principal component (FPC) analysis, along with simpler measures such as the area under the curve (AUC). The individual cities' scores on each of the temporal FPCs were then used as outcome variables in multiple linear regression analysis with various city and country characteristics as predictors. The results were compared to those of functional analysis of variance (FANOVA). Results The three first FPCs explained more than 99\% of the temporal variation. The first component (FPC1) represented the level of the drug load, while the second and third temporal components represented the level and the timing of a weekend peak. AUC was highly correlated with FPC1, but other temporal characteristic were not captured by the simple summary measures. FANOVA was less flexible than the FPCA-based regression, and even showed concordance results. Geographical location was the main predictor for the general level of the drug load. Conclusion FDA of WBE data extracts more detailed information about drug load patterns during the week which are not identified by more traditional statistical methods. Results also suggest that regression based on FPC results is a valuable addition to FANOVA for estimating associations between temporal patterns and covariate information.},

In the context of wastewater-based epidemiology, however, temperature differences among sewer catchments and within the same catchment (due to, e.g., seasonal variations) have been neglected to date as a factor influencing the estimation of illicit drug consumption. In this study, we assessed the influence of temperature on the transformation of biomarkers in wastewater and its ensuing implications on the back-calculation of chemical consumption rate in urban catchments using the example of selected illicit drugs. Literature data, obtained in laboratory-scale experiments, on the stability of drug biomarkers in untreated wastewater at trace levels was systematically reviewed, and transformation rates obtained at different temperatures were collected. Arrhenius-based equations were fitted to empirical data and identified to describe the transformation of selected cocaine and morphine biomarkers at applicability temperature range (from 2-9 degrees C to 30-31 degrees C), with estimated exponential Arrhenius coefficients between 1.04 and 1.18. These empirically-derived relationships were used to assess the influence of temperature on the transformation of drug biomarkers during in-sewer transport and its effect on the back-calculation of drug consumption rate in hypothetical urban catchment scenario simulations. Up to 4-fold increase in removal efficiency was estimated when wastewater temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C. Findings from this study can help reducing the uncertainty intrinsic to wastewater-based epidemiology studies, and will be beneficial in comparing chemical consumption estimates from different catchments worldwide.

The present study presents the result of the monitoring of sanitary sewerage in the municipality of Niteroi, a metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and its use as a complementary indicator in the surveillance of COVID19 cases, thus assisting actions of public health from local authorities. Twelve composite raw sewage samples were weekly collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and alternately from 17 sewer pipes (SP) from surrounding neighbourhoods and slums throughout 20 weeks (April 15th to August 25th, 2020). Two hundred twenty-three samples were concentrated using the ultracentrifugation-based method and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected and quantified by RT-qPCR using primers and probe targeting the N2 genome. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 84.3\% (188/223) of samples with a positive rate ranging from 42\% (5/12) in the first week of monitoring to 100\% during the peak of epidemic with viral concentration ranging from 3.1 to 7.1 log 10 genome copies /100 mL throughout the studied period. Positive rates were higher in WWTPs when compared to SP, being useful tool for monitoring trends in the evolution of the COVID-19 curve, while SP data were more effective when health public interventions were needed. Whole-genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq System confirmed the lineage of three genomes as B.1.1.33 (clade G) containing the nucleotide substitutions observed in strains that circulate in the Rio de Janeiro during the period of this study. In addition, geoprocessing tool was used to build heat maps based on SARS-CoV-2 data from sewage samples, which were weekly updated and available online to the general population as an indicator of the ongoing epidemic situation in Niteroi city, raising public awareness.

A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-levelmonitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of amass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples. Strategy1: Prefiltration-Salt addition-Electronegative membrane filtration (for initial volume = 50 mL). Strategy2: Prefiltration-PEG-based separation-Overnight standing (for initial volume from 50 to 1000 mL). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is successful in the detection of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This review examines the methods used and results of recent studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. WBE becomes essential, especially with virus transmission path uncertainty, limitations on the number of clinical tests that could be conducted, and a relatively long period for infected people to show symptoms. Wastewater surveillance was used to show the effect of lockdown on the virus spread. A WBE framework tailored for SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates lessons learnt from the reviewed studies was developed. Results of the review helped outline challenges facing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. A comparison between the various studies with regards to sample concentration and virus quantification was conducted. Five different primers sets were used for qPCR quantification; however, due to limited data availability, there is no consensus on themost sensitive primer. Correlating the slope of the relationship between the number of gene copies vs. the cumulative number of infections normalized to the total population served with the average newcases, suggests that qPCR results could help estimating the number of newinfections. The correlation is improvedwhen a lag period was introduced to account for asymptomatic infections. Based on lessons learnt fromrecent studies, it is recommended that future applications should consider the following: 1) ensuring occupational safety in managing sewage collection and processing, 2) evaluating the effectiveness of greywater disinfection, 3) measuring viral RNA decay due to biological and chemical activities during collection and treatment, 4) assessing the effectiveness of digital PCR, and 5) conducting large scale international studies that follow standardized protocols.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of ongoing challenges and presents an increased risk of illness in group environments, including jails, long-term care facilities, schools, and residential college campuses. Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

This study evaluated the accuracy of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) reported populations, as well as hydro-chemical parameters, against accurate populations from a population census. 104 catchment maps were received from WWTPs, geolocated in geospatial software and overlaid with the smallest area unit of the Australian census, equating to 14.9 million Australians or 64\% of the national population. We characterized each catchment for population counts, as well as by age profile, income profile, and education level. For a subset of sites, population estimates using hydrochemical parameters BOD, COD, and dissolved ammonia were evaluated for accuracy against census populations. Population estimates provided by WWTP personnel were on average 18\% higher than census-based populations. Furthermore, hydrochemical-based population estimates had high RSD ({$>$}44\%) for BOD, COD, and ammonium between sites, suggesting that their applicability for use in population estimation may not be appropriate for every WWTP. Catchment age distributions were evaluated and 46\% of catchments had skewed age distributions: 6\% were skewed older, and 40\% were skewed younger. Through this process WWTP catchment populations can be characterized in a way that will enhance the interpretations of per capita estimates.},

The CF is usually the excretion factor (EF) of the drug or metabolite (the fraction of drug excreted after consumption and the molecular mass ratio of parent drug/metabolite) traditionally determined by human pharmacokinetic studies. An alternative approach to derive CFs is to compare the consumption data with the loads measured by WBE in representative wastewater samples. For this purpose, during the 2016 Australian Census week, more than 500 wastewater samples were collected from 83 wastewater treatment plants across Australia (covering {$>$}60\% of the Australian population) and analyzed for codeine, methadone, and methadone metabolite, EDDP. National sales data for codeine and methadone to local pharmacies were obtained to estimate the CFs for the three biomarkers. The CFs estimated for codeine and EDDP in this study, 29\% (95\% CI = 28\%-30\%) and 50\% (95\% CI = 49\%-52\%), respectively, are significantly different from the EFs deduced from pharmacokinetic data (60\% and 25\%), while methadone's CF is relatively similar to previously used values (22\% vs 27.5\%). The newly derived CFs were applied to available data in the literature and produced better matches between estimates and consumption data than previously reported. It is thus suggested that the new approach be used to derive the CFs of other drugs of interest for WBE application when limited pharmacokinetic data are available.},

Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases in a community that are associated with a positive detection of the virus in wastewater. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank (n = 57) and biological activated sludge tank (n = 52) located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that depending on which nucleocapsid gene is targeted by means of RT-qPCR, a range of 253-409 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting RNA SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The frequency of detecting N1 and N2 gene in wastewater was also higher than that for N3 gene. Furthermore, nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2 were detected at lower frequency in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. In particular, N1 gene abundance was associated with water quality parameters such as total organic carbon and pH. In instances of positive detection, the average abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were reduced by 50 and 70\% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments already occurring in the early stages of the wastewater treatment process.},

  abstract = {Tobacco smoking remains an important public health issue worldwide. Assessment of exposure to tobacco-related toxicants and carcinogens at the population level is thus an essential population health indicator. This can be achieved by wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which relies on the analysis of biomarkers in wastewater. However, required analytical methods for the simultaneous measurement of tobacco-related toxicants and carcinogens in wastewater are not available. In this study, a new analytical procedure was developed and validated to measure tobacco-related alkaloids, carcinogens, and their metabolites in raw wastewater, including anabasine (ANABA), anatabine (ANATA), cotinine (COT), trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (COT-OH), N-nitro-soanabasine (NAB), N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridy1)-1-butanol (NNAL), NNAL-N-beta-glucuronide, and NNAL-O-beta-glucuronide. Different parameters were optimized for the solid-phase extraction procedure and instrumental analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The optimized method was fully validated, resulting in acceptable within-run and between-run precision ({$<$}8\% and {$<$}10\% relative standard deviation, respectively) and accuracy ({$<$}9\% and {$<$}13\% bias, respectively). Method quantification limits were at 0.5-120 ng/L in wastewater. Target analytes were stable in wastewater at 4 and 20 degrees C over 24 h. The developed method was applied to wastewater samples from two Belgian cities. Average concentrations of COT, COT-OH, ANATA, ANABA, and NAT were 5200, 2600, 30, 10, and 0.6 ng/L, respectively, while NAB, NNN, NNK, and NNAL were not detected in the samples. With the developed robust analytical method, our study provided the first insight into the population exposure to both toxicants and carcinogens resulting from tobacco use.},

The WRRF is the largest single-site wastewater treatment facility in the US, and it receives wastewater from its service area via three main interceptors: Detroit River Interceptor (DRI), North Interceptor-East Arm (NI-EA), and Oakwood-Northwest-Wayne County Interceptor (O-NWI). A total of 54 untreated wastewater samples were collected (18 per interceptor) at the point of intake into the WRRF. Viruses were isolated from wastewater using electropositive NanoCeram column filters (Argonide, Sanford, Florida). For each sample, an average of 45 L of wastewater was passed through NanoCeram electropositive cartridge filters at a rate of no more than 11.3 L/m. Viruses were eluted and concentrated and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) concentrations were quantified with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 100\% of samples, and measured concentrations were in the range of 104-105 genomic copies/L. Quantification of concentrations of human viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, in wastewater is a critical first step in the development of wastewater-based epidemiology predictive methods. However, accurate prediction involves the incorporation of multiple other measurements, data, and processes, such as the estimation of fate and detention times of viruses in the sewer collection network, estimation of contributing population, incorporation of disease characteristics based on anthropometric data, and others. A viral disease prediction model (Viral PD) that incorporates all these other inputs is currently being developed for COVID-19 in Detroit, Michigan.

In this study, we investigated the spatial consumption pattern of metformin in China through wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 21 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 19 cities of the northeast China. A method using solid-phase extraction combined with N-Methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) derivatization for GC-MS detection was applied for metformin analysis. In 21 days, metformin showed high stability in wastewater at 24 degrees C and -20 degrees C. The mean concentrations of metformin in all WWTPs ranged from 2.42 mu g L-1 to 53.6 mu g L-1 . The consumption of metformin was 0.66-15.6 mg d(-1) capita(-1) with the mean value of 5.54 +/- 4.28 mg d(-1) capita(-1) . The prevalence of metformin ranged from 0.09\% to 2.10\% with an average of 0.74\%. Both the consumption and prevalence of metformin displays significant spatial variations in northeast China. A statistical correlation analysis indicated that the consumption of metformin increases with the decrease of per capita disposable income of urban residents. To further predict the use of metformin in China, we developed a regress model and depicted a consumption map. The annual consumption of urban residents in Chinese provinces range from 1085-63,828 kg yr(-1) with mean value of 25,347 kg yr(-1) , which would provide a certain reference value for public health care and diabetes control.

However, the application of the conventional back estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Recent reports have shown that majority of the individuals recovered from COVID-19 have serious health complications, which is going to be a huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test every individual in densely populated countries. Recent reports have shown that sewage-based surveillance can be used as holistic approach to understand the spread of the pandemic within a population or area. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India, which is a home for nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. Interestingly, inlet samples of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative, which indicates that the standard sewage treatment methods are efficient in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Based on the detected viral gene copies per litre and viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated. Through this study we suggest that sewage-based surveillance is an effective approach to study the infection dynamics, which helps in efficient management of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.

  abstract = {Cocaine use seems to be increasing in some urban areas worldwide, but it is not straightforward to determine the real extent of this phenomenon. Trends in drug abuse are currently estimated indirectly, mainly by large-scale social, medical, and crime statistics that may be biased or too generic. We thus tested a more direct approach based on 'field' evidence of cocaine use by the general population. Cocaine and its main urinary metabolite (benzoylecgonine, BE) were measured by mass spectrometry in water samples collected from the River Po and urban waste water treatment plants of medium-size Italian cities. Drug concentration, water flow rate, and population at each site were used to estimate local cocaine consumption. We showed that cocaine and BE are present, and measurable, in surface waters of populated areas. The largest Italian river, the Po, with a five-million people catchment basin, steadily carried the equivalent of about 4 kg cocaine per day. This would imply an average daily use of at least 27 ± 5 doses (100 mg each) for every 1000 young adults, an estimate that greatly exceeds official national figures. Data from waste water treatment plants serving medium-size Italian cities were consistent with this figure. This paper shows for the first time that an illicit drug, cocaine, is present in the aquatic environment, namely untreated urban waste water and a major river. We used environmental cocaine levels for estimating collective consumption of the drug, an approach with the unique potential ability to monitor local drug abuse trends in real time, while preserving the anonymity of individuals.

  abstract = {Even though a body of data on the environmental occurrence of medicinal, government-approved ("ethical") pharmaceuticals has been growing over the last two decades (the focus of this book), nearly nothing is known about the disposition of illicit (illegal) drugs in the environment. Whether illicit drugs are similarly discharged to and survive in the environment (as discussed for medicinal drugs in the previous chapters of this book) and, if so, whether they have adverse effects on native biota is completely unknown. Regardless, with the newly acquired ability of environmental chemists to monitor for medicinal drugs in environmental samples, science is now afforded the rare opportunity to simultaneously advance the understanding of a pollution process (i.e., the inadvertent discharge of illicit drugs to the environment via their purposeful use) and to also have the ability to impact public discourse and social policy on a highly controversial subject, namely, the pervasive manuf., trade, and use of illegal drugs and abused controlled substances. The idea proposed in this chapter provides a rare bridge between the environmental and social sciences. The central aspect to the proposal centers on the use of nonintrusive drug monitoring at sewage treatment facilities and the use of the resulting nonincriminating data to det. collective drug usage parameters at the community level as well as to provide exposure data for the aquatic realm. This is the first feasible approach to obtaining real-time data that truly reflects community-wide usage of drugs, while concurrently assuring the inviolable confidentiality of every individual. At the same time, this approach yields environmental data for a class of potential pollutants never before considered as such. This proposal, which merely capitalizes on science's existing tech. capabilities in anal. chem., is ground-breaking in its parallel objectives of (i) advancing our understanding of the intimate, immediate, and inseparable connection between humans and their environment (through personal use of chems.), and (ii) furthering a national debate regarding the use/abuse of illicit and recreational drugs; any national discussion on the purported adverse effects of illicit drugs on a wide spectrum of societal concerns and issues should be helped with the availability of hard data regarding usage. In this sense, the capability outlined here is unique in its purpose of linking social discourse with the furthering of our understanding of environmental processes (such as the fate and effects of pollutants). Implementation of this proposal on either limited local levels, nationwide, or internationally could provide a radically innovative approach and totally new dimension to the decades-old quest of understanding the overall issue of illicit drug use as well as informing the public on the perceived widespread use and the many purported consequences of illicit/recreational drugs.

  abstract = {Background: Polydrug use potentially increases the likelihood of harm. As little is known about polydrug use patterns in the general population, it is difficult to determine patterns associated with highest likelihood. Methods: Latent class analysis was performed on nine illicit substance groups indicating past year use of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD, mushrooms, amyl nitrate, tranquillisers and heroin or crack. Analyses were based on data from a large multi-stage probability sample of the population of Great Britain (n= 8538) collected in 2000. Multinomial logistic regression was performed highlighting associations between classes, and demographic and mental health variables. Results: A three class solution best described patterns of polydrug use; wide range, moderate range, and no polydrug use. For males and young people, there was a significantly increased chance of being in the wide and moderate range polydrug use groups compared to the no polydrug use class. Hazardous drinking was more likely in the wide and moderate polydrug classes with odds ratios of 9.99 and 2.38 (respectively) compared to the no polydrug use class. Current smokers were more likely to be wide and moderate range polydrug users compared to the no polydrug use class with odds ratios of 4.53 and 5.85 respectively. A range of mental health variables were also related to class membership. Conclusions: Polydrug use in Great Britain can be expressed as three distinct classes. Hazardous alcohol use and tobacco use were strongly associated with illicit polydrug use, polydrug use appeared to be significantly associated with mental health, particularly lifetime suicide attempts. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

To tackle drug abuse in changing scenarios, international drug agencies need fresh methods to monitor trends and patterns of illicit drug consumption. Objective: We tested a sewage epidemiology approach, using levels of excreted drug residues in wastewater, to monitor collective use of the major drugs of abuse in near real time. Methods: Selected drug target residues derived from use of cocaine, opiates, cannabis, and amphetamines were measured by mass spectrometry in wastewater collected at major sewage treatment plants in Milan (Italy), Lugano (Switzerland), and London (United Kingdom). The amounts of drug residues conveyed to the treatment plants, reflecting the amounts collectively excreted with urine, were used to estimate consumption of the active parent drugs. Results: Reproducible and characteristic profiles of illicit drug use were obtained in the three cities, thus for the first time quickly revealing changes in local consumption (e.g., cocaine consumption rose significantly on weekends in Milan). Profiles of local drug consumption based on wastewater measurements are in line with national annual prevalence estimates. Conclusions: Patterns and trends of drug abuse in local communities can be promptly monitored by this tool, a convenient new complement to more complex, lengthy survey methods. In principle, searching the sewage for excreted compounds relevant to public health issues appears to have the potential to become a convenient source of real-time epidemiologic information.},

A specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. All these compounds were found widely at the μg/L level. Mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. Some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of Italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. There were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. Most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. Nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. Caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. This exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics.},

In this Review, Andersson and Hughes discuss the ecology of antibiotics, the ability of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics to select for resistance and the effects of low-level drug exposure on bacterial physiology. The widespread use of antibiotics results in the generation of antibiotic concentration gradients in humans, livestock and the environment. Thus, bacteria are frequently exposed to non-lethal (that is, subinhibitory) concentrations of drugs, and recent evidence suggests that this is likely to have an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. In this Review, we discuss the ecology of antibiotics and the ability of subinhibitory concentrations to select for bacterial resistance. We also consider the effects of low-level drug exposure on bacterial physiology, including the generation of genetic and phenotypic variability, as well as the ability of antibiotics to function as signalling molecules. Together, these effects accelerate the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria among humans and animals.},

  abstract = {Globalization of food networks increases opportunities for the spread of foodborne pathogens beyond borders and jurisdictions. High resolution whole-genome sequencing (WGS) subtyping of pathogens promises to vastly improve our ability to track and control foodborne disease, but to do so it must be combined with epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and other health care data (called "contextual data") to be meaningfully interpreted for regulatory and health interventions, outbreak investigation, and risk assessment. However, current multi-jurisdictional pathogen surveillance and investigation efforts are complicated by time-consuming data re-entry, curation and integration of contextual information owing to a lack of interoperable standards and inconsistent reporting. A solution to these challenges is the use of 'ontologies'-hierarchies of well-defined and standardized vocabularies interconnected by logical relationships. Terms are specified by universal IDs enabling integration into highly regulated areas and multi-sector sharing (e.g., food and water microbiology with the veterinary sector). Institution-specific terms can be mapped to a given standard at different levels of granularity, maximizing comparability of contextual information according to jurisdictional policies. Fit-for-purpose ontologies provide contextual information with the auditability required for food safety laboratory accreditation. Our research efforts include the development of a Genomic Epidemiology Ontology (GenEpiO), and Food Ontology (FoodOn) that harmonize important laboratory, clinical and epidemiological data fields, as well as existing food resources. These efforts are supported by a global consortium of researchers and stakeholders worldwide. Since foodborne diseases do not respect international borders, uptake of such vocabularies will be crucial for multi-jurisdictional interpretation of WGS results and data sharing.},

  abstract = {Forecast reliability and accuracy is a prerequisite for successful hydrological applications. This aim may be attained by using data assimilation techniques such as the popular Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Despite its recognized capacity to enhance forecasting by creating a new set of initial conditions, implementation tests have been mostly carried out with a single model and few catchments leading to case specific conclusions. This paper performs an extensive testing to assess ensemble bias and reliability on 20 conceptual lumped models and 38 catchments in the Province of Québec with perfect meteorological forecast forcing. The study confirms that EnKF is a powerful tool for short range forecasting but also that it requires a more subtle setting than it is frequently recommended. The success of the updating procedure depends to a great extent on the specification of the hyper-parameters. In the implementation of the EnKF, the identification of the hyper-parameters is very unintuitive if the model error is not explicitly accounted for and best estimates of forcing and observation error lead to overconfident forecasts. It is shown that performance are also related to the choice of updated state variables and that all states variables should not systematically be updated. Additionally, the improvement over the open loop scheme depends on the watershed and hydrological model structure, as some models exhibit a poor compatibility with EnKF updating. Thus, it is not possible to conclude in detail on a single ideal manner to identify an optimal implementation; conclusions drawn from a unique event, catchment, or model are likely to be misleading since transferring hyper-parameters from a case to another may be hazardous. Finally, achieving reliability and bias jointly is a daunting challenge as the optimization of one score is done at the cost of the other.},

  abstract = {In an operational context, efficient decision-making is usually the ultimate objective of hydrometeorological forecasts. Because of the uncertainties that lay within the forecasting process, decisions are subject to uncertainty. A better quantification of uncertainties should provide better decisions, which often translate into optimal use and economic value of the forecasts. Six Early Warning Systems (EWS) based on contrasted forecasting systems are constructed to investigate how the quantification of uncertainties affects the quality of a decision. These systems differ by the location of the sources of uncertainty, and the total amount of uncertainty they take into account in the forecasting process. They are assessed with the Relative Economic Value (REV), which is a flexible measure to quantify the potential economic benefits of an EWS. The results show that all systems provide a gain over the case where no EWS is used. The most complex systems, i.e. those that consider more sources of uncertainty in the forecasting process, are those that showed the most reduced expected damages. Systems with better accuracy and reliability are generally the ones with higher REV, even though our analysis did not show a clear-cut relationship between overall forecast quality and REV in the context investigated.},

However, due to the intrinsic random fluctuations of the viral signal in wastewater caused by several influencing factors that cannot be determined in detail (e.g. dilutions; number of people discharging; variations in virus excretion; water consumption per day; transport and fate processes in sewer system), the subsequent prevalence analysis may result in misleading conclusions. It is thus helpful to apply data filtering techniques to reduce the noise in the signal. In this paper we investigate 13 smoothing algorithms applied to the virus signals monitored in four wastewater treatment plants in Austria. The parameters of the algorithms have been defined by an optimization procedure aiming for performance metrics. The results are further investigated by means of a cluster analysis. While all algorithms are in principle applicable, SPLINE, Generalized Additive Model and Friedman's Super Smoother are recognized as superior methods in this context (with the latter two having a tendency to over-smoothing). A first analysis of the resulting datasets indicates the positive effect of filtering to the correlation of the viral signal to monitored incidence values.},

ABMs track heterogeneities within microbial populations, and this has been demonstrated to yield different predictions of bulk behaviors than the conventional, “lumped” approaches for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) completely mixed reactors systems. Current work included the application of the ABM approach to bacterial adaptation/evolution, using the model system of individual EBPR bacteria that are allowed to evolve a kinetic parameter (maximum glycogen storage) in a competitive environment. The ABM approach was successfully implemented to a simple anaerobic-aerobic system and it was found the differing initial states converged to the same optimal solution under uncertain hydraulic residence times associated with completely mixed hydraulics. In another study, an ABM was developed and applied to simulate the heterogeneity in intracellular polymer storage compounds, including polyphosphate (PP), in functional microbial populations in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. The simulation results were compared to the experimental measurements of single-cell abundance of PP in polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), performed using Raman microscopy. The model-predicted heterogeneity was generally consistent with observations, and it was used to investigate the relative contribution of external (different life histories) and internal (biological) mechanisms leading to heterogeneity. In the future, ABMs could be combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to understand incomplete mixing, more intracellular states and mechanisms can be incorporated, and additional experimental verification is needed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For the first time, this approach was simultaneously applied in 19 European cities, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a 1-week period. An inter-laboratory comparison study was performed to evaluate the analytical performance of the participating laboratories. Raw 24-hour composite sewage samples were collected from 19 European cities during a single week in March 2011 and analyzed for the urinary biomarkers of cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and cannabis using in-house optimized and validated analytical methods. The load of each substance used in each city was back-calculated from the measured concentrations. The data show distinct temporal and spatial patterns in drug use across Europe. Cocaine use was higher in Western and Central Europe and lower in Northern and Eastern Europe. The extrapolated total daily use of cocaine in Europe during the study period was equivalent to 356. kg/day. High per capita ecstasy loads were observed in Dutch cities, as well as in Antwerp and London. In general, cocaine and ecstasy loads were significantly elevated during the weekend compared to weekdays. Per-capita loads of methamphetamine were highest in Helsinki and Turku, Oslo and Budweis, while the per capita loads of cannabis were similar throughout Europe. This study shows that a standardized analysis for illicit drug urinary biomarkers in sewage can be applied to estimate and compare the use of these substances at local and international scales.

If detected, the genetic sequences of polioviruses isolated from ES are compared with those of isolates from clinical cases to evaluate the relationships among viruses. To evaluate poliovirus transmission, ES programs must be developed in a manner that is sensitive, with sufficiently frequent sampling, appropriate isolation methods, and specifically targeted sampling sites in locations at highest risk for poliovirus transmission. After poliovirus ceased to be detected in human cases, ES documented the absence of endemic WPV transmission and detected imported WPV. ES provides valuable information, particularly in high-density populations where AFP surveillance is of poor quality, persistent virus circulation is suspected, or frequent virus reintroduction is perceived. Given the benefits of ES, GPEI plans to continue and expand ES as part of its strategic plan and as a supplement to AFP surveillance.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in datasets. Automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models, which require a labelled dataset for their calibration, or unsupervised models, which do not require labels. While academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection, the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive, objective, and systematic. This knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study, where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems. To this end, anomaly detection performance, labelling efforts, as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account. As a result, our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning. Most importantly, our results show that expert-based data annotation is extremely valuable for anomaly detection based on machine learning.},

  abstract = {Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95\% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5\% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for MEDLINE included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and ‘2019-nCoV’. Additional searches were done in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the World Health Organization Database, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, social media and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results: Twenty-six relevant articles were identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9\% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. The duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33~days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47~days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. Conclusion: There is a high rate of positive polymerase chain reaction tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {Background: The viral shedding duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully defined. Consecutive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens is essential for determining duration of virus shedding and providing evidence to optimize the clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Research Question: What are the shedding durations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens? What are their associated risk factors? Study Design and Methods: A total of 68 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were recruited. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and sputum were carried out. The clinical characteristics of patients were recorded for further analysis. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from NPSs in 48 patients (70.6\%), and from sputum specimens in 30 patients (44.1\%). The median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens (34 days; interquartile range [IQR], 24-40) was significantly longer than from NPSs (19 days; IQR, 14-25; P {$<$} .001). Elderly age was an independent factor associated with prolonged virus shedding time of SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.01-2.93). It was noteworthy that in 9 patients, the viral RNA was detected in sputum after NPS turned negative. Chronic lung disease and steroids were associated with virus detection in sputum, and diabetes mellitus was associated with virus detection in both NPS and sputum. Interpretation: These findings may impact a test based clearance discharge criteria given patients with COVID-19 may shed virus longer in their lower respiratory tracts, with potential implication for prolonged transmission risk. In addition, more attention should be given to elderly patients who might have prolonged viral shedding duration.},

  abstract = {The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces has led to speculation that it can be transmitted via the fecal-oral/ocular route. This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2\% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3\% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 102–105 gc/ml) and feces (ca. 102–107 gc/ml) is much lower than in nasopharyngeal fluids (ca. 105–1011 gc/ml). There is strong evidence of multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut and infectious virus has occasionally been recovered from both urine and stool samples. The level and infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2 in vomit remain unknown. In comparison to enteric viruses transmitted via the fecal-oral route (e.g. norovirus, adenovirus), the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted via feces or urine appears much lower due to the lower relative amounts of virus present in feces/urine. The biggest risk of transmission will occur in clinical and care home settings where secondary handling of people and urine/fecal matter occurs. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA genetic material can be detected by in wastewater, this signal is greatly reduced by conventional treatment. Our analysis also suggests the likelihood of infection due to contact with sewage-contaminated water (e.g. swimming, surfing, angling) or food (e.g. salads, shellfish) is extremely low or negligible based on very low predicted abundances and limited environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2. These conclusions are corroborated by the fact that tens of million cases of COVID-19 have occurred globally, but exposure to feces or wastewater has never been implicated as a transmission vector.},

  abstract = {Background Since the emergence of COVID-19, tens of millions of people have been infected, and the global death toll approached 1 million by September 2020. Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses in adherence with the PRISMA-IPD guidelines. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models and analyzed the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4\%) – representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to – not at – symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV infection. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement AEB acknowledges support from an internship at the Institute for Disease Modeling.

In this paper, we investigate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for time series classification. Such networks have been widely used in many domains like computer vision and speech recognition, but only a little for time series classification. We design a convolu-tional neural network that consists of two convolutional layers. One drawback with CNN is that they need a lot of training data to be efficient. We propose two ways to circumvent this problem: designing data-augmentation techniques and learning the network in a semi-supervised way using training time series from different datasets. These techniques are experimentally evaluated on a benchmark of time series datasets.},

However, more research is needed to apply and develop systematic methods to interpret the true SARS-CoV-2 signal from noise introduced in wastewater samples (e.g., from sewer conditions, sampling and extraction methods, etc.). In this study, raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded COVID-19 clinical testing data. SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected (95\% positivity) in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new COVID-19 cases were 2.4 or more per 100,000 people. To adjust for variation in sample fecal content, four normalization biomarkers were evaluated: crAssphage, pepper mild mottle virus, Bacteroides ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and human 18S rRNA. Of these, crAssphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability. Both unnormalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal and signal normalized to crAssphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data (Kendall's Tau-b (τ)=0.43 and 0.38, respectively), but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data. Locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends, and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date (versus the result date) was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data. This study supports that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in COVID-19 disease occurrence and presents tools that could be applied to make wastewater signal more interpretable and comparable across studies.},

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review article is to introduce agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation and demonstrate its value and potential as a novel research method applied in nursing science. METHODS: An introduction to ABM and simulation is described. Examples of current research literature on the subject are provided. A case study example of community nursing and opioid dependence is presented. RESULTS: The use of ABM and simulation in human health research has increased dramatically over the past decade, and meaningful research is now commonly found published widely in respected, peer-reviewed journals. Absent from this list is innovative ABM and simulation research published by nurse researchers in nursing-specific journals. DISCUSSION: ABM and simulation is a powerful method with tremendous potential in nursing research. It is vital that nursing embrace and adopt innovative and advanced research methods if we are to remain a progressive voice in health research, practice, and policy.},

However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and ϕ6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and ϕ6 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26\% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6\% of the two non-enveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1\% (±3.6\%) and 18.2\% (±9.5\%) for the enveloped MHV and ϕ6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6\% (±16.7\%) and 85.5\% (±24.5\%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7\% of MHV and 2\% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.},

A promising way to addressing these issues is by developing and using water quality models. Many of these models have been developed in recent years to facilitate the management of SNs. Given the proliferation of different water quality models and the promise they have shown, it is timely to assess the state-of-the-art in this field, to identify potential challenges and suggest future research directions. In this review, model types, modeled quality parameters, modeling purpose, data availability, type of case studies and model performance evaluation are critically analyzed and discussed based on a review of 110 papers published between 2010 and 2019. The review identified that applications of empirical and kinetic models dominate those of data-driven models for addressing water quality issues. The majority of models are developed for prediction and process understanding using experimental or field sampled data. While many models have been applied to real problems, the corresponding prediction accuracies are overall moderate or, in some cases, low, especially when dealing with larger SNs. The review also identified the most common issues associated with water quality modeling of SNs and based on these proposed several future research directions. These include the identification of appropriate data resolutions for the development of different SN models, the need and opportunity to develop hybrid SN models and the improvement of SN model transferability.},

A wide variety of these tools have emerged, from simple aggregated conceptual models of entire systems, to very detailed physically based relationships for particular processes such as suspended transport. The major investors in this research have been determined to produce commercial models which will form part of integrated system analysis suites of software for use in the formulation of holistic and optimum managerial methods for wastewater systems. Unfortunately, sewer processes are extremely complex, and the very limited investment, when compared proportionately with that made in hydrological and hydraulic analysis over previous decades, has produced apparently gaps in underlying knowledge which are not generally acknowledged. This paper reviews the current position with regard to sewer process modelling, highlighting areas where knowledge is still deficient, and where new opportunities and limitations are emerging.}

Condition assessment models for sewage pipelines can be considered as a helpful tool to achieve such objective and from which a decision regarding the required and appropriate intervention can be made. This paper presents a review for the different physical, Artificial Intelligence and statistical models that have been developed to assess the condition of sewage pipelines over a period from 1998 through 2019. The description of different techniques used in building the condition assessment models, and the data required to construct these models are presented. In addition, the major disadvantages and limitations of using these techniques in developing the models have also been discussed. The conducted literature review indicates that various condition assessment models were capable of precisely forecasting the future condition of sewer pipelines. Most of the developed assessment models have been validated with various identified techniques to ensure the adequacy of the predictions. The main problem in model development arises from data availability and liability as several factors were identified by researchers to impact the deterioration of sewer pipelines. In order to overcome this problem, municipalities must utilize the new emerging technologies to facilitate gathering the required dataset in a complete and precise manner. Also, certain techniques such as evidential reasoning or Bayesian Belief Network can be used due to their capabilities in dealing with missing data. Furthermore, the influence of the factors on the pipe condition were identified by some researchers. Although there were discrepancies in the findings, but the majority concluded that both age and material factors have high influence and pipe slope has low influence.},

However, sewers still transport similar quantities of solids and pollutants, leading to increased wastewater concentration and, potentially, excess solids deposition. The shift towards decentralised water schemes in cities and widely reported changes in rainfall patterns cast additional uncertainty on future wastewater quality and flows into sewers. Excess solids deposition in sewers can cause increased environmental pollution risks at Combined Sewer Overflows from solids resuspension and reduced sewer hydraulic capacities. This review analyses the magnitude of excess solids deposition due to changing wastewater composition and evaluates current approaches to modelling sewer solids. Gaps in commonly used modelling approaches for deposited bed processes, specifically in bed consolidation and bed particle cohesion processes, and gross solids transport were identified and addressed to enable better solids risk prediction and management.},

A wastewater surveillance program should provide rapid turn around for sample measurements (ideally within 24 hours), but storage of samples is necessary for a variety of reasons including biobanking. Here we investigate how storage of wastewater solids at 4~°C, −20~°C, and −80~°C affects measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We find that short term (7 or 8 d) storage of raw solids at 4~°C has little effect on measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas longer term storage at 4~°C (35–122 d) or freezing reduces measurements by 60\%, on average. We show that normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by concentrations of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, an endogenous wastewater virus, can correct for changes during storage as storage can have a similar effect on PMMoV RNA as on SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The reductions in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids during freeze thaws is less than those reported for the same target in liquid influent by several authors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model  is a popular model to forecast future values of a time series using the past values of the same series. However, if the variance of the time series varies with time, the 95\% confidence interval estimated by the ARIMA will not be accurate. This study proposes a method to revise the ARIMA model to suit time series with heteroscedasticity. METHODS: Multiple historical ARIMA models were constructed with publicly available COVID-19 data in Alberta, Canada. The time series between different time periods were applied for these models. The means and their 95\% confidence intervals of the differences between the forecasted values and the corresponding actual values were computed. The forecasted values of the general ARIMA models were modified by adding these differences. RESULTS: The average incident cases forecasted with the proposed method are lower than those with general ARIMA models during the forecasted period. The 95\% confidence intervals of the forecasted incidence with the proposed method are narrower. During the forecasted period (13 weeks) the average incidence was predicted to increase first and then decrease exponentially. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can be used to automatically specify the best ARIMA model, to fit time series with heteroscedasticity and to forecast longer period of the trends in the future. In the next 13 weeks, the Covid-19 incidence may decrease but not eliminate. To stop the transmission of infections eventually, persistent effects comply with accurate forecasts are necessary.},

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays rely on a fixed genetic sequence for primer and probe binding. Mutations can potentially alter the accuracy of these assays and lead to unpredictable analytical performance characteristics and false-negative results. Here, we identify a G-to-U transversion (nucleotide 26372) in the SARS-CoV-2 E gene in three specimens with reduced viral detection efficiency using a widely available commercial assay. Further analysis of the public GISAID repository led to the identification of 18 additional genomes with this mutation, which reflect five independent mutational events. This work supports the use of dual-target assays to reduce the number of false-negative PCR results.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the novel Coronavirus, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread rapidly, causing millions of deaths worldwide. As in most countries of the world, in Brazil, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been catastrophic. Several studies have reported the fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers from infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used to track the virus spread in a population. In this study, samples of untreated wastewater were collected for 44 weeks at five sampling sites in the ABC Region (São Paulo, Brazil), in order to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in the sewerage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers were detected throughout the period, and the concentration ranged from 2.7 to 7.7 log10 genome copies.L−1, with peaks in the last weeks of monitoring. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater and the epidemiological/clinical data, with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks. The COVID-19 prevalence for each sampling site was estimated via Monte-Carlo simulation using the wastewater viral load. The mean predicted prevalence ranged 0.05 to 0.38\%, slightly higher than reported (0.016 ± 0.005\%) in the ABC Region for the same period. These results highlight the viability of the wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 infection monitoring in the largest urban agglomeration in South America. This approach can be especially useful for health agencies and public decision-makers in predicting SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as well as in local tracing of infection clusters.},

Editor: Damià Barceló We measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in raw wastewater in Attica, Greece, by RT-qPCR for the environmental surveillance of COVID-19 for 6 months. The lag between RNA load and pandemic indicators (COVID-19 hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions) was calculated using a grid search. Our results showed that RNA load in raw wastewater is a leading indicator of positive COVID-19 cases, new hospitalization and admission into ICUs by 5, 8 and 9 days, respectively. Modelling techniques based on distributed/fixed lag modelling, linear regression and artificial neural networks were utilized to build relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in wastewater and pandemic health indicators. SARS-CoV-2 mutation analysis in wastewater during the third pandemic wave revealed that the alpha-variant was dominant. Our results demonstrate that clinical and environmental surveillance data can be combined to create robust models to study the ongoing COVID-19 infection dynamics and provide an early warning for increased hospital admissions.},

Positive wastewater samples triggered clinical testing of residents within that dorm; thus, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified regardless of symptom expression. This current study examined clinical testing data to determine the abundance of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases in these defined communities. Nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples processed via antigen and PCR tests indicated that 79.2\% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic, and only 20.8\% of positive cases reported COVID-19 symptoms at the time of testing. Clinical data was paired with corresponding wastewater virus concentrations, which enabled calculation of viral shedding rates in feces per infected person. Mean shedding rates averaged from positive wastewater samples across all dorms were 7.30 ± 0.67 log10 genome copies per gram of feces (gc/g-feces) based on the N1 gene. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding rates from infected individuals has been the critical missing component necessary for WBE models to measure and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in communities. The findings from this study can be utilized to create models that can be used to inform public health prevention and response actions.},

Strategic lockdowns and mandatory social distancing are immediate solutions in such scenarios. However, this leads to operational disruptions in education, manufacturing, economy, transportation, governance, and community. Although technological assistance is beneficial in overcoming such issues, the current Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure has limitations. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the possible IoT-based solutions that have the capacity of combating the COVID-19-like viruses. We highlight the societal impacts due to pandemics and identify the specific lacunae in current IoT solutions. We also provide comprehensive detail on how to overcome the challenges along with directions toward the possible technological trends for future research. Compared to existing reviews, our work offers a holistic view of the cause, effects, and the possible solutions that are existing, along with already existing solutions that can be customized to serve the special needs during the pandemic.},

Methods: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Conclusions: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.},

  abstract = {The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 \% limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was ≥96 \% for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.},

For this study, uncultured viruses were concentrated by tangential flow filtration, and viral RNA was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cDNA libraries for sequencing analysis. The vast majority of the 36,769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic RNA viruses. The most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which was found in high concentrations—up to 109 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter. PMMV was also detected in 12 (66.7\%) of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents, indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population. A number of pepper-based foods tested positive for PMMV, suggesting dietary origins for this virus. Intriguingly, the fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants, suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses.},

In our proposed approach, we have employed a combination of two applications for analysis, namely Network Workbench and CiteSpace-wherein Network Workbench allowed for the analysis of complex network aspects of the domain, detailed visualization-based analysis of the bibliographic data was performed using CiteSpace. Our results include the identification of the largest cluster based on keywords, the timeline of publication of index terms, the core journals and key subject categories. We also identify the core authors, top countries of origin of the manuscripts along with core research institutes.

  abstract = {Testing surfaces in school classrooms for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide public-health information that complements clinical testing. We monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in five schools (96 classrooms) in Davis, California (USA) by collecting weekly surface-swab samples from classroom floors and/or portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) units. Twenty-two surfaces tested positive, with qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 36.07–38.01. Intermittent repeated positives in a single room were observed for both floor and HEPA filter samples for up to 52 days, even following regular cleaning and HEPA filter replacement after a positive result. We compared the two environmental sampling strategies by testing one floor and two HEPA filter samples in 57 classrooms at Schools D and E. HEPA filter sampling yielded 3.02\% and 0.41\% positivity rates per filter sample collected for Schools D and E, respectively, while floor sampling yielded 0.48\% and 0\% positivity rates. Our results indicate that HEPA filter swabs are more sensitive than floor swabs at detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in interior spaces. During the study, all schools were offered weekly free COVID-19 clinical testing. On-site clinical testing was offered in Schools D and E, and upticks in testing participation were observed following a confirmed positive environmental sample. However, no confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among students associated with classrooms yielding positive environmental samples. The positive samples detected in this study appeared to reflect relic viral RNA from individuals infected before the monitoring program started and/or RNA transported into classrooms via fomites. The high-Ct positive results from environmental swabs further suggest the absence of active infections. Additional research is needed to differentiate between fresh and relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental samples and to determine what types of results should trigger interventions. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This study was funded by Healthy Davis Together/Healthy Yolo Together \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

  abstract = {Monitoring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is necessary to make informed public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. PCR assays have received global attention, facilitating rapid understanding of variant dynamics because they are more accessible and scalable than genome sequencing. However, as PCR assays target only a few mutations, their accuracy could be compromised when these mutations are not exclusive to target variants. Here we show how to design variant-specific PCR assays with high sensitivity and specificity across different geographical regions by incorporating sequences deposited in the GISAID database. Furthermore, we demonstrate that several previously developed PCR assays have decreased accuracy outside their study areas. We introduce PRIMES, an algorithm that enables the design of reliable PCR assays, as demonstrated in our experiments to track dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in local sewage samples.

In addition, tracking of pathogen concentrations over time could potentially provide a measure of the effectiveness of public health control measures and the impact of the gradual relaxation of these controls. Analysis of wastewater using quantitative molecular methods offers a real-time measure of infections in the community, and thus is expected to provide a more sensitive and rapid indication of changes in infection rates before such effects become detectable by clinical health surveillance. Models may help to back-calculate wastewater prevalence to population prevalence or to correct pathogen counts for wastewater catchment-specific and temporal effects. They may also help to design the wastewater sampling strategy.

  abstract = {Background: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be an important source of information for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management during and after the pandemic. Currently, governments and transportation industries around the world are developing strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with resuming activity. This study investigated the possible use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater surveillance from airline and cruise ship sanitation systems and its potential use as a COVID-19 public health management tool. Methods: Aircraft and cruise ship wastewater samples (n = 21) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using two virus concentration methods, adsorption-extraction by electronegative membrane (n = 13) and ultrafiltration by Amicon (n = 8), and five assays using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). Representative qPCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced to confirm assay specificity. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in samples from both aircraft and cruise ship wastewater; however concentrations were near the assay limit of detection. The analysis of multiple replicate samples and use of multiple RT-qPCR and/or RT-ddPCR assays increased detection sensitivity and minimized false-negative results. Representative qPCR amplicons were confirmed for the correct PCR product by sequencing. However, differences in sensitivity were observed among molecular assays and concentration methods. Conclusions: The study indicates that surveillance of wastewater from large transport vessels with their own sanitation systems has potential as a complementary data source to prioritize clinical testing and contact tracing among disembarking passengers. Importantly, sampling methods and molecular assays must be further optimized to maximize detection sensitivity. The potential for false negatives by both wastewater testing and clinical swab testing suggests that the two strategies could be employed together to maximize the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst passengers.},

  abstract = {Controlling importation and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from overseas travelers is essential for countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, and other island nations, that have adopted a suppression strategy to manage very low community transmission. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has emerged as a promising tool employed in public health response in many countries globally. This study aimed to establish whether the surveillance of aircraft wastewater can be used to provide an additional layer of information to augment individual clinical testing. Wastewater from 37 long-haul flights chartered to repatriate Australians was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Children 5 years or older on these flights tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (deep nasal and oropharyngeal reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR swab) 48 h before departure. All passengers underwent mandatory quarantine for 14-day post arrival in Howard Springs, NT, Australia. Wastewater from 24 (64.9 \%) of the 37 flights tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. During the 14 day mandatory quarantine, clinical testing identified 112 cases of COVID-19. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in repatriation flight wastewater using pooled results from three RT-qPCR assays demonstrated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.5 \%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.9 \% and 83.7\% accuracy for COVID-19 cases during the post-arrival 14-day quarantine period. The study successfully demonstrates that the surveillance of wastewater from aircraft for SARS-CoV-2 can provide an additional and effective tool for informing the management of returning overseas travelers and for monitoring the importation of SARS CoV-2 and other clinically significant pathogens.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed millions of lives to date. Antigenic drift has resulted in viral variants with putatively greater transmissibility, virulence, or both. Early and near real-time detection of these variants of concern (VOC) and the ability to accurately follow their incidence and prevalence in communities is wanting. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which uses nucleic acid amplification tests to detect viral fragments, is a reliable proxy of COVID-19 incidence and prevalence, and thus offers the potential to monitor VOC viral load in a given population. Here, we describe and validate a primer extension PCR strategy targeting a signature mutation in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2. This allows quantification of B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7 allele frequency in wastewater without the need to employ quantitative RT-PCR standard curves. We show that the wastewater B.1.1.7 profile correlates with its clinical counterpart and benefits from a near real-time and facile data collection and reporting pipeline. This assay can be quickly implemented within a current SARS-CoV-2 WBE framework with minimal cost; allowing early and contemporaneous estimates of B.1.1.7 community transmission prior to, or in lieu of, clinical screening and identification. Our study demonstrates that this strategy can provide public health units with an additional and much needed tool to rapidly triangulate VOC incidence/prevalence with high sensitivity and lineage specificity.},

Wastewater-based COVID-19 epidemiology programs have been initiated in many countries to provide public health agencies with a complementary disease tracking metric and non-discriminating surveillance tool.

In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral signal was measured in primary clarified sludge harvested every two days at the City of Ottawa's water resource recovery facility during the summer of 2020, when clinical testing recorded daily percent positivity below 1\%. In late July, increases of {$>$}400\% in normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater were identified 48 h prior to reported {$>$}300\% increases in positive cases that were retrospectively attributed to community-acquired infections. During this resurgence period, SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater preceded the reported {$>$}160\% increase in community hospitalizations by approximately 96 h. This study supports wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance of populations in augmenting the efficacy of diagnostic testing, which can suffer from sampling biases or timely reporting as in the case of hospitalization census.},

  abstract = {In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health-care, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty. Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. ≈ 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. ≈ 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 gene regions in PCS (92.7, 90.6\%, n = 6) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3\%, n = 5). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human 18S rRNA, making PMMoV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMoV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMoV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.},

  abstract = {In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cases shed SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with their faeces. To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1-N3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the first Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6-30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1-N3 up to 790-2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated significantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.},

Basic research has provided critical insights into the mechanism regulating fear behavior in animals and a host of animal models have been developed in order to screen compounds for anxiolytic properties. Despite this progress, no mechanistically novel agents for the treatment of anxiety have come to market in more than two decades.Areas covered: The current review will provide a critical summary of current pharmacological approaches to the treatment of anxiety and will examine the pharmacotherapeutic pipeline for treatments in development. Anxiety and related disorders considered herein include panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The glutamate, neuropeptide and endocannabinoid systems show particular promise as future targets for novel drug development.Expert opinion: In the face of an ever-growing understanding of fear-related behavior, the field awaits the translation of this research into mechanistically novel treatments. Obstacles will be overcome through close collaboration between basic and clinical researchers with the goal of aligning valid endophenotypes of human anxiety disorders with improved animal models. Novel approaches are needed to move basic discoveries into new, more effective treatments for our patients.},

  abstract = {The setup for measuring the SHG is described in the supporting online material (22). We expect that the SHG strongly depends on the resonance that is excited. Obviously, the incident polarization and the detuning of the laser wavelength from the resonance are of particular interest. One possibility for controlling the detuning is to change the laser wavelength for a given sample, which is difficult because of the extremely broad tuning range required. Thus, we follow an alternative route, lithographic tuning (in which the incident laser wavelength of 1.5 mm, as well as the detection system, remains fixed), and tune the resonance positions by changing the SRR size. In this manner, we can also guarantee that the optical properties of the SRR constituent materials are identical for all configurations. The blue bars in Fig. 1 summarize the measured SHG signals. For excitation of the LC resonance in Fig. 1A (horizontal incident polarization), we find an SHG signal that is 500 times above the noise level. As expected for SHG, this signal closely scales with the square of the incident power (Fig. 2A). The polarization of the SHG emission is nearly vertical (Fig. 2B). The small angle with respect to the vertical is due to deviations from perfect mirror symmetry of the SRRs (see electron micrographs in Fig. 1). Small detuning of the LC resonance toward smaller wavelength (i.e., to 1.3-mm wavelength) reduces the SHG signal strength from 100\% to 20\%. For ex-citation of the Mie resonance with vertical incident polarization in Fig. 1D, we find a small signal just above the noise level. For excitation of the Mie resonance with horizontal incident polarization in Fig. 1C, a small but significant SHG emission is found, which is again polarized nearly vertically. For completeness, Fig. 1B shows the off-resonant case for the smaller SRRs for vertical incident polarization. Although these results are compatible with the known selection rules of surface SHG from usual nonlinear optics (23), these selection rules do not explain the mechanism of SHG. Following our above argumentation on the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, we numerically calculate first the linear electric and magnetic field distributions (22); from these fields, we compute the electron velocities and the Lorentz-force field (fig. S1). In the spirit of a metamaterial, the transverse component of the Lorentz-force field can be spatially averaged over the volume of the unit cell of size a by a by t. This procedure delivers the driving force for the transverse SHG polarization. As usual, the SHG intensity is proportional to the square modulus of the nonlinear electron displacement. Thus, the SHG strength is expected to be proportional to the square modulus of the driving force, and the SHG polarization is directed along the driving-force vector. Corresponding results are summarized in Fig. 3 in the same arrangement as Fig. 1 to allow for a direct comparison between experiment and theory. The agreement is generally good, both for linear optics and for SHG. In particular, we find a much larger SHG signal for excitation of those two resonances (Fig. 3, A and C), which are related to a finite magnetic-dipole moment (perpendicular to the SRR plane) as compared with the purely electric Mie resonance (Figs. 1D and 3D), despite the fact that its oscillator strength in the linear spectrum is comparable. The SHG polarization in the theory is strictly vertical for all resonances. Quantitative deviations between the SHG signal strengths of experiment and theory, respectively, are probably due to the simplified SRR shape assumed in our calculations and/or due to the simplicity of our modeling. A systematic microscopic theory of the nonlinear optical properties of metallic metamaterials would be highly desirable but is currently not available.}

  abstract = {Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from wastewater using conventional treatment technologies and there is limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs. In this study, we used the “fractionated approach” that accounts for the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate the fate of 26 target CECs in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that includes primary, secondary and tertiary treatment steps. Prior hydraulic calibration of each treatment unit was performed. Wastewater and sludge samples were collected at different locations along the treatment train and the concentrations of target CECs were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The most substantial aqueous removal occurred during activated sludge treatment (up to 99\%). Removals were {$<~$}50\% in the primary clarifier and tertiary rotating biological contactors (RBCs) and up to 70\% by sand filtration. Mass balance calculations demonstrated that (bio)degradation accounted for up to 50\% of the removal in the primary clarifier and 100\% in activated sludge. Removal by sorption to primary and secondary sludge was minimal for most CECs. Analysis of the selected metabolites demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and secondary treatments.},

  abstract = {The shedding of pathogens by infected humans enables the use of sewage monitoring to conduct wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Although most WBE studies use data from large sewage treatment plants, timely data from smaller catchments are needed for targeted public health action. Traditional sampling methods, like autosamplers or grab sampling, are not conducive to quick ad hoc deployments and high-resolution monitoring at these smaller scales. This study develops and validates a cheap and easily deployable passive sampler unit, made from readily available consumables, with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic but with broader use for WBE. We provide the first evidence that passive samplers can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from populations with low prevalence of active COVID-19 infections (0.034 to 0.34 per 10,000), demonstrating their ability for early detection of infections at three different scales (lot, suburb, and city). A side by side evaluation of passive samplers (n = 245) and traditionally collected wastewater samples (n = 183) verified that the passive samplers were sensitive at detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. On all 33 days where we directly compared traditional and passive sampling techniques, at least one passive sampler was positive when the average SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the wastewater equaled or exceeded the quantification limit of 1.8 gene copies per mL (n = 7). Moreover, on 13 occasions where wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were less than 1.8 gene copies per mL, one or more passive samplers were positive. Finally, there was a statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.001) positive relationship between the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the levels found on the passive samplers, indicating that with further evaluation, these devices could yield semi-quantitative results in the future. Passive samplers have the potential for wide use in WBE with attractive feasibility attributes of cost, ease of deployment at small-scale locations, and continuous sampling of the wastewater. Further research will focus on the optimization of laboratory methods including elution and extraction and continued parallel deployment and evaluations in a variety of settings to inform optimal use in wastewater surveillance.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the world. Several studies have shown that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater can be a useful tool to identify new outbreaks, establish outbreak trends, and assess the prevalence of infections. On 06 May 2021, over a year into the pandemic, we conducted a scoping review aiming to summarize research data on SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. Papers dealing with raw sewage collected at wastewater treatment plants, sewer networks, septic tanks, and sludge treatment facilities were included in this review. We also reviewed studies on sewage collected in community settings such as private or municipal hospitals, healthcare facilities, nursing homes, dormitories, campuses, airports, aircraft, and cruise ships. The literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded 1090 results, 66 of which met the inclusion criteria and are discussed in this review. Studies from 26 countries worldwide have investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage of different origin. The percentage of positive samples in sewage ranged from 11.6 to 100\%, with viral concentrations ranging from ˂LOD to 4.6\,×\,108 genome copies/L. This review outlines the evidence currently available on wastewater surveillance: (i) as an early warning system capable of predicting COVID-19 outbreaks days or weeks before clinical cases; (ii) as a tool capable of establishing trends in current outbreaks; (iii) estimating the prevalence of infections; and (iv) studying SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity. In conclusion, as a cost-effective, rapid, and reliable source of information on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the population, wastewater surveillance can enhance genomic and epidemiological surveillance with independent and complementary data to inform public health decision-making during the ongoing pandemic.},

  abstract = {ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations.The ARTIC Network provides a common resource of PCR primer sequences and recommendations for amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. IMPORTANCE ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.},

  abstract = {Background: The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2), first identified in India, is currently replacing pre-existing variants in many parts of the world. To help guide public health policies it is important to monitor efficiently its spread. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a rapid, simple and inexpensive alternative to sequencing for Delta identification. Methods: A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR) was developed. The technique exploits allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3′ end. Specificity was assessed by testing well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. Results: In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants (Alpha and Beta), and ‘wild-type’ SARS-CoV-2. Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. Conclusion: The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant globally.},

  abstract = {Background The effective reproductive number, Re, is a critical indicator to monitor disease dynamics, inform regional and national policies, and estimate the effectiveness of interventions. It describes the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious person through time. To date, Re estimates are based on clinical data such as observed cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths. These estimates are temporarily biased when clinical testing or reporting strategies change. Objectives We show that the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to estimate Re in near real-time, independent of clinical data and without the associated biases. Methods We collected longitudinal measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Zurich, CH, and San Jose (CA), USA. We combined this data with information on the temporal dynamics of shedding (the shedding load distribution) to estimate a time series proportional to the daily COVID-19 infection incidence. We estimated a wastewater-based Re from this incidence. Results The method to estimate Re from wastewater works robustly on data from two different countries and two wastewater matrices. The resulting estimates are as similar to the Re estimates from case report data as Re estimates based on observed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are among each other. We further provide details on the effect of sampling frequency and the shedding load distribution on the ability to infer Re. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first time Re has been estimated from wastewater. This method provides a low cost, rapid, and independent way to inform SARS-CoV-2 monitoring during the ongoing pandemic and is applicable to future wastewater-based epidemiology targeting other pathogens. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement XFC, TS, CO, TRJ and TK acknowledge funding from the Swiss National Science foundation (Special Call on Coronaviruses; 31CA30\textbackslash\_196267 and 31CA30\textbackslash\_196538).

  abstract = {Contrary to the conventional genomic surveillance based on clinical samples (symptomatic patients), the wastewater-based genomic surveillance can identify all the variants shed by the infected individuals in the population, as it does also include RNA fragmented shredded by clinically escaped asymptomatic patients. We analyzed four samples to detect key mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and track circulating variants in Ahmedabad during the first wave (Sep/ Nov 2020) and before the second wave (in Feb 2021) of COVID-19 in India. The analysis showed a total of 35 mutations in the spike protein across four samples categorized into 23 types. We noticed the presence of spike protein mutations linked to the VOC-21APR-02; B.1.617.2 lineage (Delta variant) with 57\% frequency in wastewater samples of Feb 2021. The key spike protein mutations were T19R, L452R, T478K, D614G, \& P681R and deletions at 22029 (6 bp), 28248 (6 bp), \& 28271 (1 bp). Interestingly, these mutations were not observed in the samples of Sep and Nov 2020 but appeared before the devastating second wave of COVID-19, which started in early April 2021 in India, caused rapid transmission and deaths all over India. We found the genetic traces of the B.1.617.2 in samples of early Feb 2021 i.e., more than a month before the first clinically confirmed case of the same variant in March 2021 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The present study tells about the circulating variants in Ahmedabad and suggests early prediction VOCs employing the wastewater genomic surveillance approach that must be exploited at a large scale for effective COVID-19 management.

We investigated the entire population of the Principality of Liechtenstein with samples from the wastewater treatment plant Bendern (serving all 39,000 inhabitants). Twenty-four-hour composite samples were taken once or twice a week over a period of 6 months from September 2020 to March 2021. Viral RNA was concentrated using the PEG centrifugation method followed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. The aim of this research was to assess the suitability of SARS-CoV-2 fragments to relate the viral wastewater signal to the incidences and assess the impact of the emerging B.1.1.7. variant. The viral load in the wastewater peaked at almost 9 × 108 viral fragments per person equivalent (PE) and day on October 25, and showed a second peak on December 22 reaching a viral load of approximately 2 × 108 PE−1d−1. Individual testing showed a lag of 4 days and a distinct underestimation of cases at the first peak when testing frequency was low. The wastewater signal showed an immediate response to the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The new virus variant B.1.1.7. was first detected in wastewater on December 23, while it was first observed with individual testing on January 13, 2021. Further, our data indicate that the emergence of new virus variant may change the wastewater signal, probably due to different shedding patterns, which should be considered in future models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Traumatic experiences are ubiquitous in the lives of homeless people, stemming from multiple life events prior to, and as a result of, experiencing homelessness. While most studies examine either burnout and vicarious traumatization or potential PTSD in people who work with those who are traumatized, they generally do not look at the possible co-existence of all three factors. They also do not explore if these factors indicate the extent to which burnout or vicarious traumatization may lead to PTSD symptoms or that the existence of PTSD symptoms may precipitate greater rates of burnout. In~addition, there are no existing studies that provide a quantitative view of the characteristics of frontline workers in homeless services. In this study, we surveyed 472 individuals who work in frontline positions in homeless shelters in 23 different organizations. We found rates of burnout, vicarious traumatization and compassion satisfaction, comparable to workers in other social services organizations but found rates of PTSD symptoms to be at 33\% of the total population. This higher incidence of PTSD symptoms suggests that workers under-report traumatic stress when it is described as vicarious traumatization, that they specifically attribute this to client contact, and that vicarious traumatization is traumatic stress specifically attributed to job-related events.},

This approach can be particularly helpful in understanding outbreaks of disease like the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) when combined with clinical datasets. In this study, three RT-ddPCR assays (N1, N2, N3) were used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in weekly samples from nine WWTPs in southeastern Virginia. In the first several weeks of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 detections were sporadic. Frequency of detections and overall concentrations of RNA within samples increased from mid March into late July. During the twenty-one week study, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 101 to 104 copies 100 mL−1 in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials.

  abstract = {The quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in wastewater has emerged as a useful tool to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks in the community. This approach was implemented in the metropolitan area of A Coruña (NW Spain), where wastewater from a treatment plant was analyzed to track the epidemic dynamics in a population of 369,098 inhabitants. Statistical regression models from the viral load detected in the wastewater and the epidemiological data from A Coruña health system that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people, including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, with reliability close to 90\%, were developed. These models can help to understand the real magnitude of the epidemic in a population at any given time and can be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks. The methodology of the present work could be used to develop a similar wastewater-based epidemiological model to track the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic anywhere in the world. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement Authors would like to give special thanks to the Board of Directors from EDAR Bens.

A logarithmic unit increase in viral RNA count in wastewater was associated with a 26.9\% increase in COVID-19 rate per 100,000 inhabitants (95\% CI: 13.1-42.4\%), within the urban area, six days later.

There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed.},

  abstract = {• SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater are influenced by several factors. • Correlations with clinical epidemiology suggest unexplained variability. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA is a promising complementary approach to monitor community viral circulation. A myriad of factors, however, can influence RNA concentrations in wastewater, impeding its epidemiological value. This article aims to provide an overview and discussion of factors up to the sampling stage that impact SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration estimates in wastewater. To this end, a systematic review was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase) and two preprint servers (MedRxiv and BioRxiv). Two authors independently screened and selected articles published between January 1, 2019 and May 4, 2021. A total of 22 eligible articles were included in this systematic review. The following factors up to sampling were identified to have an influence on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater and its interpretation: (i) shedding-related factors , including faecal shedding parameters (i.e. shedding pattern, recovery, rate, and load distribution), (ii) population size, (iii) in-sewer factors, including solid particles, organic load, travel time, flow rate, wastewater pH and temperature , and (iv) sampling strategy. In conclusion, factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration estimates in waste-water were identified and research gaps were discussed. The identification of these factors supports the need for further research on WBS for COVID-19.},

When in human feces, it is of dietary origin from peppers and their processed products, and is excreted from a large proportion of healthy human populations, but rarely found in animal feces. Over the past decade, this virus has been increasingly attracting research attention as a potential viral indicator for human fecal pollution in aquatic environments and water treatment systems. Results presented in the literature reveal that PMMoV is globally distributed and present in various water sources in greater abundance than human pathogenic viruses, without substantial seasonal fluctuations. Several studies report that increased concentrations of PMMoV tend to be correlated with increased fecal contamination in general, along with more frequent detection of pathogenic enteric viruses. PMMoV also exhibits remarkable stability in water under various environmental conditions. Here, we review recent advancements in our understanding of the occurrence and persistence of PMMoV in natural and engineered water systems and discuss its advantages and limitations as a viral indicator for improved microbial water quality management.},

  abstract = {First-principles modeling of dynamical systems is a cornerstone of science and engineering and has enabled rapid development and improvement of key technologies such as chemical reactors, electrical circuits, and communication networks. In various disciplines, scientists structure the available domain knowledge into a system of differential equations. When designed, calibrated, and validated appropriately, these equations are used to analyze and predict the dynamics of the system. However, perfect knowledge is usually not accessible in real-world problems. The incorporated knowledge thus is a simplification of the real system and is limited by the underlying assumptions. This limits the extent to which the model reflects reality. The resulting lack of predictive power severely hampers the application potential of such models. Here we introduce a framework that incorporates machine learning into existing first-principles modeling. The machine learning model fills in the knowledge gaps of the first-principles model, capturing the unmodeled dynamics and thus improving the representativeness of the model. Moreover, we show that this approach lowers the data requirements, both in quantity and quality, and improves the generalization ability in comparison with a purely data-driven approach. This approach can be applied to any first-principles model with sufficient data available and has tremendous potential in many fields.},

Sequencing data from clinical cases has provided data crucial to understanding disease transmission and the detection, surveillance, and containment of outbreaks of novel variants, which continue to pose fresh challenges. However, genomic wastewater surveillance can provide important complementary information by providing estimates of variant frequencies which do not suffer from sampling bias, and capturing all variants circulating in a population. Here we show that genomic SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance can detect fine-scale differences within urban centres, specifically within the city of Liverpool, UK, during the emergence of Alpha and Delta variants between November 2020 and June 2021. Overall, the correspondence between wastewater and clinical variant frequencies demonstrates the reliability of wastewater surveillance. Yet, discrepancies between the two approaches when the Alpha variant was first detected emphasises that wastewater monitoring can also capture missing information resulting from asymptomatic cases or communities less engaged with testing programmes, as found by a simultaneous surge testing effort across the city. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Clinical Protocols {$<$}https://www.protocols.io/view/wastewater-sequencing-using-the-easyseq-rc-pcr-sar-bx6dpra6{$>$}  \#\#\# Funding Statement Funding was provided by NERC (NE/V003860/1) and DHSC UK (2020\textbackslash\_097).

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is being used worldwide to understand COVID-19 infection trends in a community. We found the emergence and rapid timeline for dominance of the Omicron variant was accurately reflected in wastewater when measured with droplet digital (dd)PCR. We were able to distinguish Omicron from the circulating Delta variant because Omicron has a mutation in the N1 probe binding region that diminished the fluorescent signal within individual droplets. The ddPCR platform may be advantageous for wastewater surveillance since analysis of the data can segregate fluorescent signals from different individual templates. In contrast, platforms such as qPCR that rely solely on the intensity of fluorescence for quantification would not distinguish a subset of variants with mutations affecting the reaction and could underestimate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. The proportion of Omicron in wastewater was tightly correlated to clinical cases in five cities and provided a higher resolution timeline of appearance and dominance ({$>$}75\%) than sequenced clinical samples, which were limited in less populated areas.

Here, we develop distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate IRs using concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater solids and investigate the impact of sampling frequency on model performance. SARS-CoV-2 N gene and PMMoV RNA concentrations were measured daily at four wastewater treatment plants in California. Artificially reduced datasets were produced for each plant with sampling frequencies of once every 2, 3, 4, and 7 days. Sewershed-specific models that related daily N/PMMoV to IR were fit for each sampling frequency with data from mid-Nov 2020 through mid-July 2021, which included the period of time during which Delta emerged. Models were used to predict IRs during a subsequent out-of-sample time period. When sampling occurred at least once every 4 days, the in- and out-of-sample root mean square error (RMSE) changed less than 7 cases/100,000 compared to daily sampling across sewersheds. This work illustrates that real-time, daily predictions of IR are possible with small error, despite changes in circulating variants, when sampling frequency is once every 4 days or more. However, reduced sampling frequency may not serve other important wastewater surveillance use cases. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement DD, BH, and BJW are employees of Verily Life Sciences \#\#\# Funding Statement CDC-FOUNDATION \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology offers a time- and cost-effective way to monitor SARS-CoV-2 spread in communities and therefore represents a complement to clinical testing. WBE applicability has been demonstrated in a number of cases over short-term periods as a method for tracking the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and an early-warning tool for predicting outbreaks in the population. This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral loads from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and hospitals over a 6-month period (June to December 2020). Results show that the overall range of viral load in positive tested samples was between 1.2\,×\,103 and 3.5\,×\,106 gene copies/L, unveiling that secondary-treated wastewaters mirrored the viral load of influents. The interpretation suggests that the viral titers found in three out of four WWTPs were associated to clinical COVID-19 surveillance indicators preceding 2–7 days the rise of reported clinical cases. The median wastewater detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was one out of 14,300 reported new cases. Preliminary model estimates of prevalence ranged from 0.02 to 4.6\% for the studied period. This comprehensive statistical and epidemiological analysis demonstrates that the applied wastewater-based approach to COVID-19 surveillance is in general consistent and feasible, although there is room for improvements.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is emerging as a potential approach to study the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 at a community level. Periodic sewage surveillance can act as an indicative tool to predict the early surge of pandemic within the community and understand the dynamics of infection and, thereby, facilitates for proper healthcare management. In this study, we performed a long-term epidemiological surveillance to assess the SARS-CoV-2 spread in domestic sewage over one year (July 2020 to August 2021) by adopting longitudinal sampling to represent a selected community (\textasciitilde 2.5 lakhs population). Results indicated temporal dynamics in the viral load. A consistent amount of viral load was observed during the months from July 2020 to November 2020, suggesting a higher spread of the viral infection among the community, followed by a decrease in the subsequent two months (December 2020 and January 2021). A marginal increase was observed during February 2021, hinting at the onset of the second wave (from March 2021) that reached it speak in April 2021. Dynamics of the community infection rates were calculated based on the viral gene copies to assess the severity of COVID-19 spread. With the ability to predict the infection spread, longitudinal WBE studies also offer the prospect of zoning specific areas based on the infection rates. Zoning of the selected community based on the infection rates assists health management to plan and manage the infection in an effective way. WBE promotes clinical inspection with simultaneous disease detection and management, in addition to an advance warning signal to anticipate outbreaks, with respect to the slated community/zones, to tackle, prepare for and manage the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Effective wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA requires the rigorous characterization of the limit of detection resulting from the entire sampling process - the process limit of detection (PLOD). Yet to date, no studies have gone beyond quantifying the assay limit of detection (ALOD) for RT-qPCR or RT-dPCR assays. While the ALOD is the lowest number of gene copies (GC) associated with a 95\% probability of detection in a single PCR reaction, the PLOD represents the sensitivity of the method after considering the efficiency of all processing steps (e.g., sample handling, concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and PCR assays) to determine the number of GC in the wastewater sample matrix with a specific probability of detection. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the PLOD resulting from the combination of primary concentration and extraction with six SARS-CoV-2 assays: five RT-qPCR assays (US CDC N1 and N2, China CDC N and ORF1ab (CCDC N and CCDC ORF1ab), and E\_Sarbeco RT-qPCR, and one RT-dPCR assay (US CDC N1 RT-dPCR) using two models (exponential survival and cumulative Gaussian). An adsorption extraction (AE) concentration method (i.e., virus adsorption on membrane and the RNA extraction from the membrane) was used to concentrate gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 seeded into 36 wastewater samples. Overall, the US CDC N1 RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR assays had the lowest ALODs ({$<$} 10 GC/reaction) and PLODs ({$<$}3,954 GC/50 mL; 95\% probability of detection) regardless of the seeding level and model used. Nevertheless, consistent amplification and detection rates decreased when seeding levels were {$<$} 2.32 × 103 GC/50 mL even for US CDC N1 RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR assays. Consequently, when SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations are expected to be low, it may be necessary to improve the positive detection rates of wastewater surveillance by analyzing additional field and RT-PCR replicates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the SARS-CoV-2 PLOD for wastewater and provides important insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater.},

Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in a community is pivotal for appropriate public health response. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples for tracking variants is challenging, often resulting in low coverage genome sequences, thereby impeding the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Therefore, we aimed at high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from sewage samples which we successfully accomplished. This first pan-European surveillance compared the mutation profiles associated with the variants of concerns: B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 across 20 European countries, including 54 municipalities. The results highlight that SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in the wastewater samples mirror the variants profiles reported in clinical data. This study demonstrated that {$>$}98\% coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences is possible and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater to support identifying variants circulating in a city at the community level.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology has been used to measure SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in cities worldwide as an indicator of community health, however, few longitudinal studies have followed SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in small communities from the start of the pandemic or evaluated the influence of tourism on viral loads. Therefore the objective of this study was to use measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to monitor viral trends and variants in a small island community over a twelve-month period beginning May 1, 2020, before the community re-opened to tourists. Wastewater samples were collected weekly and analyzed to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Sanger sequencing was used to determine genome sequences from total RNA extracted from wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. Visitor data was collected from the local Chamber of Commerce. We performed Poisson and linear regression to determine if visitors to the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2-positive wastewater samples and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results indicated that weekly wastewater samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 until mid-July when positive samples were recorded in four of five consecutive weeks. Additional positive results were recorded in November and December 2020, as well as January, March, and April 2021. Tourism data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater increased by 1.06 Log10 genomic copies/L per 100 tourists weekly. Sequencing from six positive wastewater samples yielded two complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2, two overlapping sequences, and two low yield sequences. They show arrival of a new variant SARS-CoV-2 in January 2021. Our results demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in a small community. Wastewater surveillance and viral genome sequencing suggest that population mobility likely plays an important role in the introduction and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants among communities experiencing high tourism and who have a small population size.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based surveillance has been widely used as a non-intrusive tool to monitor population-level transmission of COVID-19. Although various approaches are available to concentrate viruses from wastewater samples, scalable methods remain limited. Here, we sought to identify and evaluate SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration protocols for high-throughput wastewater testing. A total of twelve protocols for polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and four protocols for ultrafiltration-based approaches were evaluated across two phases. The first phase entailed an initial evaluation using a small sample set, while the second phase further evaluated five methods using wastewater samples of varying SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. Permutations in the pre-concentration, virus concentration and RNA extraction steps were evaluated. Among PEG-based methods, SARS-CoV-2 virus recovery was optimal with 1) the removal of debris prior to processing, 2) 2\,h to 24\,h incubation with 8\% PEG at 4\,°C, 3) 4000 x g or 14,000 xg centrifugation, and 4) a column-based RNA extraction method, yielding virus recovery of 42.4–52.5\%. Similarly, the optimal protocol for ultrafiltration included 1) the removal of debris prior to processing, 2) ultrafiltration, and 3) a column-based RNA extraction method, yielding a recovery of 38.2\%. This study also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery for samples with higher virus concentration were less sensitive to changes in the PEG method, but permutations in the PEG protocol could significantly impact virus yields when wastewater samples with lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA were used. Although both PEG precipitation and ultrafiltration methods resulted in similar SARS-CoV-2 RNA recoveries, the former method is more cost-effective while the latter method provided operational efficiency as it required a shorter turn-around-time (PEG precipitation, 9–23\,h; Ultrafiltration, 5\,h). The decision on which method to adopt will thus depend on the use-case for wastewater testing, and the need for cost-effectiveness, sensitivity, operational feasibility and scalability.},

An extensive sampling campaign, including nine municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) on the same day in April 2020, close to the first peak of the corona crisis. Samples were processed and analysed for a set of SARS-CoV-2-specific genes, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences also covering other coronavirus types, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, a comprehensive set of chemical reference parameters and bioindicators was analysed to characterize the wastewater quality and composition. Results of the RT-qPCR based gene analysis indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic traces in different raw wastewaters. Furthermore, selected samples have been sequenced using Sanger technology to confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR and the origin of the coronavirus. A comparison of the particle-bound and the dissolved portion of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes shows that quantifications must not neglect the solid-phase reservoir. The infectivity of the raw wastewater has also been assessed by viral outgrowth assay with a potential SARS-CoV-2 host cell line in vitro, which were not infected when exposed to the samples. This first evidence suggests that wastewater might be no major route for transmission to humans. Our findings draw attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.},

Methods have been developed using both the liquid and the solid fraction of wastewater, with some studies reporting higher concentrations in solids. To investigate this relationship further, we collaborated with six other laboratories to conduct a study across five publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) where both primary solids and raw wastewater influent samples were collected and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Solids and influent samples were processed by participating laboratories using their respective methods and retrospectively paired based on date of collection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by mass (gene copies per gram) were higher in solids than in influent by approximately three orders of magnitude. Concentrations in matched solids and influent were positively and significantly correlated at all five POTWs. RNA concentrations in both solids and influent were correlated to COVID-19 incidence rates in the sewershed and thus representative of disease burden; the solids methods appeared to produce a comparable relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration measurements and incidence rates across all POTWs. Solids and influent methods showed comparable sensitivity, N gene detection frequency, and calculated empirical incidence rate lower limits. Analysis of solids has the advantage of using less sample volume to achieve similar sensitivity to influent methods. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Aaron Topol, Bradley White and Dorothea Duong are employees of Verily Life Sciences \#\#\# Funding Statement This work was partially supported by the CDC Foundation and an NSF RAPID (CBET-2023057) to K.R.W. and A.B.B, in addition to Stanford Campus Inchoen Global Campus and Stanford School of Engineering Graduate Fellowship to S.K.

  abstract = {Background Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of concern (VOCs) have repeatedly and independently arisen. VOCs are characterised by increased transmissibility, increased virulence or reduced neutralisation by antibodies obtained from prior infection or vaccination. Tracking the introduction and transmission of VOCs relies on sequencing, typically whole genome sequencing of clinical samples. Wastewater surveillance is increasingly used to track the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants through sequencing approaches. Aim Here, we adapt and apply a rapid, high-throughput method for detection and quantification of the relative frequency of two deletions characteristic of the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma VOCs in wastewater. Methods We developed drop-off RT-dPCR assays and an associated statistical approach implemented in the R package WWdPCR to analyse temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 signature mutations (spike Δ69–70 and ORF1a Δ3675–3677) in wastewater and quantify transmission fitness advantage of the Alpha VOC. Results Based on analysis of Zurich wastewater samples, the estimated transmission fitness advantage of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha based on the spike Δ69–70 was 0.34 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.30–0.39) and based on ORF1a Δ3675–3677 was 0.53 (95\% CI: 0.49–0.57), aligning with the transmission fitness advantage of Alpha estimated by clinical sample sequencing in the surrounding canton of 0.49 (95\% CI: 0.38–0.61). Conclusion Digital PCR assays targeting signature mutations in wastewater offer near real-time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and potentially earlier detection and inference on transmission fitness advantage than clinical sequencing.}

Finally, the Real Time RT-PCR was used to quantify BRSV load in BAL fluids of four experimentally infected calves for 14 days.

A class of linear-in-the-parameter models with universal approximation capabilities have been intensively studied and widely used due to the availability of many linear-learning algorithms and their inherent convergence conditions. This article presents a systematic overview of basic research on model selection approaches for linear-in-the-parameter models. One of the fundamental problems in non-linear system identification is to find the minimal model with the best model generalisation performance from observational data only. The important concepts in achieving good model generalisation used in various non-linear system-identification algorithms are first reviewed, including Bayesian parameter regularisation and models selective criteria based on the cross validation and experimental design. A significant advance in machine learning has been the development of the support vector machine as a means for identifying kernel models based on the structural risk minimisation principle. The developments on the convex optimisation-based model construction algorithms including the support vector regression algorithms are outlined. Input selection algorithms and on-line system identification algorithms are also included in this review. Finally, some industrial applications of non-linear models are discussed.},

The use of ANNs has gained increasing popularity for applications where a mechanistic description of the dependency between dependent and independent variables is either unknown or very complex. This machine learning technique can be roughly described as a universal algebraic function that will distinguish signal from noise directly from experimental data. The application of ANNs to complex relationships makes them highly attractive for the study of biological systems. Recent applications include the analysis of expression profiles and genomic and proteomic sequences.},

  abstract = {Large multilayer neural networks trained with backpropagation have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of problems. However, using backprop for neural net learning still has some disadvantages, e.g., having to tune a large number of hyperparameters to the data, lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions, and a tendency to overfit the training data. In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights.},

Combining these two viewpoints provides interesting insights to the learning process and the functions of different parts of the model. In this paper, the problem of variational Bayesian learning of hierarchical latent variable models is used to demonstrate the benefits of the two views. The code-length interpretation provides new views to many parts of the problem such as model comparison and pruning and helps explain many phenomena occurring in learning.}

In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In recent years, surface water quality has decreased due to the increasing demand for water and increasing the use of fertilizers, pesticides and the discharge of domestic and municipal wastewater to surface water. The purpose of this research is a comparison of the efficiency of different time-series models in modeling and prediction of monthly water quality performance in Harmaleh area of Khuzestan in the southwest of Iran. Water quality parameters including Ca, HCO3, SO4, Ec, pH, Mg, Cl, Na, and TDS for the period of 2001 to 2014 were evaluated. Five time-series models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA) with 12 different structures were assessed by R software. First, the data were normalized using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Also, the adequacy of data was tested by Hurst’s coefficient. The Hurst coefficient was\,{$>$}\,0.5 for all investigated parameters, which indicated suitable length of the time series for the modeling. As the components of trend, jump, and seasonality are usually specific, modeling of them is not required, but modeling of stochastic components is of importance in water resources simulation and management. Therefore, using the R software, deterministic parts of the time series (e.g., trend, jump, and seasonality) were eliminated and non-deterministic component (e.g., randomness) was simulated (from 2011 to 2014), and finally, the data were predicted (from 2015 to 2018) based on the optimized models. The optimized models were selected based on auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) as well as the use of Akaike information criteria (AIC) and coefficient of determination. Results showed that in 66\% of data ARMA [with the same rate of ARMA (1, 2), ARMA (2, 1), and ARMA (2, 2)], in 22\% of data AR (1), and in 11\% of data ARIMA (1, 1, 2) models presented the highest efficiency in monthly water quality simulation. Finally, each quality parameter was also predicted for the next 4~years (2015–2018) based on the selected optimized models. Results indicated that the values of SO4 and pH, respectively, showed the highest and lowest correlation with the related observations with a coefficient of determination of 0.54 and 0.19. Overall, modeling of water quality using stochastic models could save time and costs, especially when time series of parameters are long and adequate.},

The measurement and prediction of these parameters are essential for assessing the performance and upgrade of wastewater treatment facilities. In this study, a new methodology, combining a linear stochastic model (ARIMA) and nonlinear outlier robust extreme learning machine technique (ORELM) with various preprocesses, is presented to model the quality parameters of effluent wastewater (ARIMA-ORELM). For each of the studied parameters, 144 different (144 × 8 models) linear models (ARIMA) are presented, with the superior model of each parameter being selected based on statistical indices. Moreover, 48 nonlinear models (ORELM) and 48 hybrid models (ARIMA-ORELM) were considered. The use of linear and nonlinear approaches to model the linear and nonlinear terms (respectively) of each time series in the hybrid model increased the efficiency and accuracy of the predictions for all of the time series. The influent wastewater nonlinear TSS model and the effluent COD and BOD models attained the best performance with a high correlation coefficient of 0.95. The use of hybrid models improved the prediction capability of all quality parameters with the best performance being achieved for the effluent BOD model (R 2 = 0.99).},

While the time delay neural network model was more accurate for the two real-world wastewater data sets, the neural networks were not always more accurate than linear ARIMA for the artificial nonlinear data sets.

  abstract = {The discharge of a significant amount of wastewater from the urban agglomerations in the rivers is the primary cause for the degradation of the river's assimilative capacity. The re-aeration process represents an interaction among the air-water interface to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere and indicates the capacity of the water to hold the oxygen that can be used in the degradation of pollutants without affecting the river's health. Therefore, accurate estimation of re-aeration capacity is the prime requirement to maintain the riverine ecosystem. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to simulate the non-linear behaviour of various water quality parameters by estimating the re-aeration coefficient of Yamuna River, Delhi. The hydraulic and water quality parameters are used to identify the most optimal combination of input parameters for simulation through the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) ANFIS model. The results of ANFIS are ensembled with the time series autor-egressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to minimize bagging, non-stationarity and biasing. The performance of the ANFIS models was measured using the coefficient of determination (R 2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of correlation (R). The ARIMA models are evaluated based on standard error, p-value, and t-test. Out of the five different ANFIS models, ANFIS-5 provides the optimal values of R during training and testing of the model as 0.966 and 0.989, respectively, and integrated with the ARIMA model to obtain the re-aeration coefficient for each sampling location. The results indicate that the ensembled ANFIS-ARIMA model reduces the variance significantly with the minimum error of 0.0075 and produces an exceptional improvement in predicting the re-aeration coefficient.},

  abstract = {Clinical testing has been the cornerstone of public health monitoring and infection control efforts in communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With the extant and anticipated reduction of clinical testing as the disease moves into an endemic state, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance (WWS) is likely to have greater value as an important diagnostic tool to inform public health. As the widespread adoption of WWS is relatively new at the scale employed for COVID-19, interpretation of data, including the relationship to clinical cases, has yet to be standardized. An in-depth analysis of the metrics derived from WWS is required for public health units/agencies to interpret and utilize WWS-acquired data effectively and efficiently. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater signal to clinical cases (WC) ratio was investigated across seven different cities in Canada over periods ranging from 8 to 21 months. Significant increases in the WC ratio occurred when clinical testing eligibility was modified to appointment-only testing, identifying a period of insufficient clinical testing in these communities. The WC ratio decreased significantly during the emergence of the Alpha variant of concern (VOC) in a relatively non-immunized community’s wastewater (40-60\% allelic proportion), while a more muted decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Delta VOC in a relatively well-immunized community’s wastewater (40-60\% allelic proportion). Finally, a rapid and significant decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Omicron VOC, likely because of the variant’s greater effectiveness at evading immunity, leading to a significant number of new reported clinical cases, even when vaccine-induced community immunity was high. The WC ratio, used as an additional monitoring metric, complements clinical case counts and wastewater signals as individual metrics in its ability to identify important epidemiological occurrences, adding value to WWS as a diagnostic technology during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely for future pandemics. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This research was funded and supported by Ontario's Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks SARS-CoV-2 surveillance initiative (awarded to the University of Ottawa, the University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo), by CHEO (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario) CHAMO (Children's Hospital Academic Medical Organization) (awarded to Dr. Alex E.

Particularly when computational methods like cross-validation are applied, there is no need to stick to "standard" loss functions such as the L 2-loss (squared loss). Our main message is that the choice of a loss function in a practical situation is the translation of an informal aim or interest that a researcher may have into the formal language of mathematics. The choice of a loss function cannot be formalized as a solution of a mathematical decision problem in itself. An illustrative case study about the location of branches of a chain of restaurants is given. Statistical aspects of loss functions are treated, such as the distinction between applications of loss functions to prediction and estimation problems and the direct definition of estimators to minimize loss functions. The impact of subjective decisions to the design of loss functions is also emphasized and discussed.},

  abstract = {Ensemble techniques have been used to generate daily numerical weather forecasts since the 1990s in numerical centers around the world due to the increase in computation ability. One of the main purposes of numerical ensemble forecasts is to try to assimilate the initial uncertainty (initial error) and the forecast uncertainty (forecast error) by applying either the initial perturbation method or the multi-model/multi-physics method. In fact, the mean of an ensemble forecast offers a better forecast than a deterministic (or control) forecast after a short lead time (3-5 days) for global modelling applications. There is about a 1-2-day improvement in the forecast skill when using an ensemble mean instead of a single forecast for longer lead-time. The skillful forecast (65\% and above of an anomaly correlation) could be extended to 8 days (or longer) by present-day ensemble forecast systems. Furthermore, ensemble forecasts can deliver a probabilistic forecast to the users, which is based on the probability density function (PDF) instead of a single-value forecast from a traditional deterministic system. It has long been recognized that the ensemble forecast not only improves our weather forecast predictability but also offers a remarkable forecast for the future uncertainty, such as the relative measure of predictability (RMOP) and probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast (PQPF). Not surprisingly, the success of the ensemble forecast and its wide application greatly increase the confidence of model developers and research communities.},

  abstract = {As a cost-effective and objective population-wide surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been widely implemented worldwide to monitor the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA concentration in wastewater. However, viral concentrations or loads in wastewater often correlate poorly with clinical case numbers. To date, there is no reliable method to back-estimate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. This greatly limits WBE in achieving its full potential in monitoring the unfolding pandemic. The exponentially growing SARS-CoV-2 WBE dataset, on the other hand, offers an opportunity to develop data-driven models for the estimation of COVID-19 case numbers (both incidence and prevalence) and transmission dynamics (effective reproduction rate). This study developed artificial neural network (ANN) models by innovatively expanding a conventional WBE dataset to include catchment, weather, clinical testing coverage and vaccination rate. The ANN models were trained and evaluated with a comprehensive state-wide wastewater monitoring dataset from Utah, USA during May 2020 to December 2021. In diverse sewer catchments, ANN models were found to accurately estimate the COVID-19 prevalence and incidence rates, with excellent precision for prevalence rates. Also, an ANN model was developed to estimate the effective reproduction number from both wastewater data and other pertinent factors affecting viral transmission and pandemic dynamics. The established ANN model was successfully validated for its transferability to other states or countries using the WBE dataset from Wisconsin, USA.},

Among PIDs detection methods, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been demonstrated to be a favorable mean for estimation of community-wide health. Besides, by going beyond purely sensing usages of WBE, it can be efficiently exploited in Healthcare 4.0/5.0 for surveillance, monitoring, control, and above all prediction and prevention, thereby, resulting in smart sensing and management of potential outbreaks/epidemics/pandemics. Herein, an overview of WBE sensors for PIDs is presented. The philosophy behind the smart diagnosis of PIDs using WBE with the help of digital technologies is then discussed, as well as their characteristics to be met. Analytical techniques that are pushing the frontiers of smart sensing and have a high potential to be used in the smart diagnosis of PIDs via WBE are surveyed. In this context, we underscore key challenges ahead and provide recommendations for implementing and moving faster toward smart diagnostics.},

That is why some prediction methods are required to estimate the magnitude of infected cases and masses of studies on distinct methods of forecasting are represented so far. In this study, we proposed a hybrid machine learning model that is not only predicted with good accuracy but also takes care of uncertainty of predictions. The model is formulated using Bayesian Ridge Regression hybridized with an n-degree Polynomial and uses probabilistic distribution to estimate the value of the dependent variable instead of using traditional methods. This is a completely mathematical model in which we have successfully incorporated with prior knowledge and posterior distribution enables us to incorporate more upcoming data without storing previous data. Also, L2 (Ridge) Regularization is used to overcome the problem of overfitting. To justify our results, we have presented case studies of three countries, −the United States, Italy, and Spain. In each of the cases, we fitted the model and estimate the number of possible causes for the upcoming weeks. Our forecast in this study is based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins University available until 11th May 2020. We are concluding with further evolution and scope of the proposed model.},

The total number of cases as on 30th April is found to be 35043 confirmed cases with 1147 total deaths and 8889 recovered patients.

The model performance parameters are calculated as mean square error, root mean square error, regression score and percentage accuracy. The model has above 97\% accuracy in predicting deaths, recovered, cumulative number of confirmed cases and 87\% accuracy in predicting daily new cases. The results suggest a Gaussian decrease of the number of cases and could take another 3 to 4 months to come down the minimum level with no new cases being reported.

This approach was implemented in the metropolitan area of A Coruña (NW Spain), where wastewater from a treatment plant was analyzed to track the epidemic dynamics in a population of 369,098 inhabitants. Statistical regression models from the viral load detected in the wastewater and the epidemiological data from A Coruña health system that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people, including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, with reliability close to 90\%, were developed. These models can help to understand the real magnitude of the epidemic in a population at any given time and can be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks.

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach for estimating population-wide COVID-19 prevalence through detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater. However, various methodological challenges associated with WBE would affect the accuracy of prevalence estimation. To date, the overall uncertainty of WBE and the impact of each step on the prevalence estimation are largely unknown. This study divided the WBE approach into five steps (i.e., virus shedding; in-sewer transportation; sampling and storage; analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater; back-estimation) and further summarized and quantified the uncertainties associated with each step through a systematic review. Although the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied greatly between COVID-19 positive patients, with more than 10 infected persons in the catchment area, the uncertainty caused by the excretion rate became limited for the prevalence estimation. Using a high-frequency flow-proportional sampling and estimating the prevalence through actual water usage data significantly reduced the overall uncertainties to around 20–40\% (relative standard deviation, RSD). And under such a scenario, the analytical uncertainty of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was the dominant factor. This highlights the importance of using surrogate viruses as internal or external standards during the wastewater analysis, and the need for further improvement on analytical approaches to minimize the analytical uncertainty. This study supports the application of WBE as a complementary surveillance strategy for monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and provides methodological improvements and suggestions to enhance the reliability for future studies.},

People infected with monkeypox excrete monkeypox virus DNA via skin lesions, saliva, feces and urine and these can enter the wastewater via toilets, sinks, and shower drains. To test whether monkeypox can be detected and monitored in wastewater during a period when publicly reported monkey cases in the region were increasing, we deployed digital PCR assays that target genomic DNA from the monkeypox virus in our routine, ongoing wastewater surveillance program in the Greater Bay Area of California, USA. We measured monkeypox virus DNA daily in settled solids samples from nine wastewater plants over the period of approximately 4 weeks. During that period, we detected monkeypox virus DNA in wastewater solids at nearly all the wastewater plants we routinely sample. Frequency of occurrence and concentrations were highest at plants serving San Francisco County. To confirm the presence of monkeypox DNA, we used two assays that target distinct sequences on the monkeypox genome on a subset of samples and results from both assays were in close agreement strongly suggesting true positives in the wastewater. Additionally, we show that concentrations of monkeypox DNA is 103 times higher in the solid fraction compared to the liquid fraction of wastewater on a mass-equivalent basis. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Dorothea Duong, Bridgette Hughes, Vikram Chan-Herur, and Bradley White are employees of Verily Life Sciences. \#\#\# Funding Statement This work is supported by a gift from the CDC Foundation. \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

  abstract = {Wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology (WBE) has been established as an important tool to support individual testing strategies. Omicron sub-variants BA.4/5 have spread globally displacing the predeceasing variants. Due to the severe transmissibility and immune escape potential of BA.4/5, early monitoring was required to asses and implement countermeasures in time. In this study, we monitored the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/5 at six municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Federal State of North-Rhine-Westphalia (NRW, Germany) in May and June 2022. Initially, L452R-specific primers/probes originally designed for SARS-CoV-2 Delta detection were validated using inactivated authentic viruses and evaluated for their suitability to detect BA.4/5. Subsequently, the assay was used for RT-qPCR analysis of RNA purified from wastewater obtained twice a week at six WWTPs. The occurrence of L452R carrying RNA was detected in early May 2022 and the presence of BA.4/5 was confirmed by variant-specific single nucleotide polymorphism PCR (SNP-PCR) targeting E484A/F486V. Finally, the mutant fractions were quantitatively monitored by digital PCR confirming BA.4/5 as the majority variant by 5th June 2022. In conclusions, the successive workflow using RT-qPCR, variant-specific SNP-PCR, and RT-dPCR demonstrates the strength of WBE as a versatile tool to rapidly monitor variant spreading independent of individual test capacities. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors reports supplies provided by QIAGEN GmbH and analytical equipment provided by Analytik Jena (Endress+Hauser Group) on loan for the duration of the project.

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, application of artificial neural networks (ANN) to time-series forecasting (TSF) has been growing rapidly due to several unique features of ANN models. However, to date, a consistent ANN performance over different studies has not been achieved. Many factors contribute to the inconsistency in the performance of neural network models. One such factor is that ANN modeling involves determining a large number of design parameters, and the current design practice is essentially heuristic and ad hoc, this does not exploit the full potential of neural networks. Systematic ANN modeling processes and strategies for TSF are, therefore, greatly needed. Motivated by this need, this paper attempts to develop an automatic ANN modeling scheme. It is based on the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), a special type of neural network. By taking advantage of several GRNN properties (i.e., a single design parameter and fast learning) and by incorporating several design strategies (e.g., fusing multiple GRNNs), we have been able to make the proposed modeling scheme to be effective for modeling large-scale business time series. The initial model was entered into the NN3 time-series competition. It was awarded the best prediction on the reduced dataset among approximately 60 different models submitted by scholars worldwide. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater offers an unbiased and near real-time tool to track circulation of SARS-CoV-2 at a local scale, next to other epidemic indicators such as hospital admissions and test data. However, individual measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage are noisy, inherently variable, and can be left-censored. Aim We aimed to infer latent virus loads in a comprehensive sewage surveillance program that includes all sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Netherlands and covers 99.6\% of the Dutch population. Methods A multilevel Bayesian penalized spline model was developed and applied to estimate time- and STP-specific virus loads based on water flow adjusted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR data from 1-4 sewage samples per week for each of the {$>$}300 STPs. Results The model provided an adequate fit to the data and captured the epidemic upsurges and downturns in the Netherlands, despite substantial day-to-day measurement variation. Estimated STP virus loads varied by more than two orders of magnitude, from approximately 1012 (virus particles per 100,000 persons per day) in the epidemic trough in August 2020 to almost 1015 in many STPs in January 2022. Epidemics at the local levels were slightly shifted between STPs and municipalities, which resulted in less pronounced peaks and troughs at the national level. Conclusion Although substantial day-to-day variation is observed in virus load measurements, wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can track long-term epidemic progression at a local scale in near real-time, especially at high sampling frequency. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This research was financed by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (FM, JSPS KAKENHI Grant number 20J00793). \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

  abstract = {Since many infected people experience no or few symptoms, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is frequently monitored through massive virus testing of the population, an approach that may be biased and may be difficult to sustain in low-income countries. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome by RT-qPCR in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been carried out as a complementary tool to monitor virus circulation among human populations. However, measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by many experimental and environmental factors. To circumvent these limits, we propose here a novel indicator, the wastewater indicator (WWI), that partly reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARS-CoV-2 genome quantification in wastewater (average noise reduction of 19\%). All data processing results in an average correlation gain of 18\% with the incidence rate. The WWI can take into account the censorship linked to the limit of quantification (LOQ), allows the automatic detection of outliers to be integrated into the smoothing algorithm, estimates the average measurement error committed on the samples and proposes a solution for inter-laboratory normalization in the absence of inter-laboratory assays (ILA). This method has been successfully applied in the context of Obépine, a French national network that has been quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since March 5th 2020. By August 26th, 2021, 168 WWTPs were monitored in the French metropolitan and overseas territories of France. We detail the process of elaboration of this indicator, show that it is strongly correlated to the incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a few days, making our indicator an efficient complement to the incidence rate. This alternative approach may be especially important to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in human populations when the testing rate is low.},

Using the environmental surveillance network previously developed in Spain for the routine wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 (VATar COVID-19), we have analyzed the presence of MPXV DNA in wastewater from different areas of Spain. Samples (n=312) from 24 different wastewater treatment plants were obtained between May 9 (week 22\textbackslash\_19) and August 4 (week 22\textbackslash\_31), 2022. Following concentration of viral particles by flocculation, a qPCR procedure allowed us to detect MPXV DNA in 63 wastewater samples collected from May 16 to August 4, 2022, with values ranging between 2.2 per 103 to 8.7 per 104 genome copies (gc)/L. This study shows that MPXV DNA can be reproducibly detected by qPCR in longitudinal samples collected from different Spanish wastewater treatment plants. According to data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) in Spain a total of 6,119 cases have been confirmed as of August 19, 2022.

  abstract = {Much of what is known and theorized concerning passive sampling techniques has been developed considering chemical analytes. Yet, historically, biological analytes, such as Salmonella typhi, have been collected from wastewater via passive sampling with Moore swabs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, passive sampling is re-emerging as a promising technique to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Method comparisons and disease surveillance using composite, grab, and passive sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection have found passive sampling with a variety of materials routinely produced qualitative results superior to grab samples and useful for sub-sewershed surveillance of COVID-19. Among individual studies, SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations derived from passive samplers demonstrated heterogeneous correlation with concentrations from paired composite samples ranging from weak (R2 = 0.27, 0.31) to moderate (R2 = 0.59) to strong (R2 = 0.76). Among passive sampler materials, electronegative membranes have shown great promise with linear uptake of SARS-CoV-2 RNA observed for exposure durations of 24 to 48 h and in several cases RNA positivity on par with composite samples. Continuing development of passive sampling methods for the surveillance of infectious diseases via diverse forms of fecal waste should focus on optimizing sampler materials for the efficient uptake and recovery of biological analytes, kit-free extraction, and resource-efficient testing methods capable of rapidly producing qualitative or quantitative data. With such refinements passive sampling could prove to be a fundamental tool for scaling wastewater surveillance of infectious disease, especially among the 1.8 billion persons living in low-resource settings served by non-traditional wastewater collection infrastructure.},

In the second part we present an ontology engineering framework that supports and favours the genericity of an ontology. We introduce the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates “atomic” conceptual relations from “predicative” domain rules. A DOGMA ontology consists of an ontology base that holds sets of intuitive context-specific conceptual relations and a layer of “relatively generic” ontological commitments that hold the domain rules.

This study provides a one year review of the “COVIDPoops19” global dashboard of universities, sites, and countries monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Methods to assemble the dashboard combined standard literature review, direct submissions, and daily, social media keyword searches. Over 200 universities, 1,000 sites, and 55 countries with 59 dashboards monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, monitoring is primarily in high-income countries (65\%) with less access to this valuable tool in low and middle income countries (35\%). Data are not widely shared publicly or accessible to researchers to further inform public health actions, perform meta-analysis, better coordinate, and determine equitable distribution of monitoring sites. For WBE to be used to its full potential during COVID-19 and beyond, show us the data.},

  abstract = {Testing surfaces in school classrooms for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide public-health information that complements clinical testing. We monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in five schools (96 classrooms) in Davis, California (USA) by collecting weekly surface-swab samples from classroom floors and/or portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) units (n = 2,341 swabs). Twenty-two surfaces tested positive, with qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 36.07–38.01. Intermittent repeated positives in a single room were observed for both floor and HEPA filter samples for up to 52 days, even following regular cleaning and HEPA filter replacement after a positive result. We compared the two environmental sampling strategies by testing one floor and two HEPA filter samples in 57 classrooms at Schools D and E. HEPA filter sampling yielded 3.02\% and 0.41\% positivity rates per filter sample collected for Schools D and E, respectively, while floor sampling yielded 0.48\% and 0\% positivity rates. Our results indicate that HEPA filter swabs are more sensitive than floor swabs at detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in interior spaces. During the study, all schools were offered weekly free COVID-19 clinical testing through Healthy Davis Together (HDT). HDT also offered on-site clinical testing in Schools D and E, and upticks in testing participation were observed following a confirmed positive environmental sample. However, no confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among students associated with classrooms yielding positive environmental samples. The positive samples detected in this study appeared to contain relic viral RNA from individuals infected before the monitoring program started and/or RNA transported into classrooms via fomites. High-Ct positive results from environmental swabs detected in the absence of known active infections supports this conclusion. Additional research is needed to differentiate between fresh and relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental samples and to determine what types of results should trigger interventions.},

  abstract = {In this study, 14 virus concentration protocols based on centrifugation, filtration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and ultrafiltration were tested for their efficacy for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. These protocols were paired with four RNA extraction procedures resulting in a combination of 50 unique approaches. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was used as a process control and seeded in each wastewater sample subjected to all 50 protocols. The recovery of BRSV obtained through the application of 50 unique approaches ranged from {$<$}0.03 to 64.7\% (±1.6\%). Combination of centrifugation as the solid removal step, ultrafiltration (Amicon-UF-15; 100~kDa cut-off; protocol 9) as the primary virus concentration method, and Zymo Quick-RNA extraction kit provided the highest BRSV recovery (64.7~±~1.6\%). To determine the impact of prolonged storage of large wastewater sample volume (900~mL) at −20~°C on enveloped virus decay, the BRSV seeded wastewaters samples were stored at −20~°C up to 110~days and analyzed using the most efficient concentration (protocol 9) and extraction (Zymo Quick-RNA kit) methods. BRSV RNA followed a first-order decay rate (k~=~0.04/h with r2~=~0.99) in wastewater. Finally, 21 wastewater influent samples from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in southern Maryland, USA were analyzed between May to August 2020 to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantifiable in 17/21 (81\%) of the influent wastewater samples with concentration ranging from 1.10 (±0.10)~×~104 to 2.38 (±0.16)~×~106~gene~copies/L. Among the RT-qPCR assays tested, US CDC N1 assay was the most sensitive followed by US CDC N2, E\_Sarbeco, and RdRp assays. Data presented in this study may enhance our understanding on the effective concentration and extraction of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater.},

Public health authorities use clinical surveillance to locate and monitor influenza and influenza-like cases and outbreaks to mitigate hospitalizations and deaths. Currently, global integration of clinical surveillance is the only reliable method for reporting influenza types and subtypes to warn of emergent pandemic strains. The utility of wastewater surveillance (WWS) during the COVID-19 pandemic as a less resource intensive replacement or complement for clinical surveillance has been predicated on analyzing viral fragments in wastewater. We show here that influenza virus targets are stable in wastewater and partitions favorably to the solids fraction. By quantifying, typing, and subtyping the virus in municipal wastewater and primary sludge during a community outbreak, we forecasted a citywide flu outbreak with a 17-day lead time and provided population-level viral subtyping in near real-time to show the feasibility of influenza virus WWS at the municipal and neighbourhood levels in near real time using minimal resources and infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Monkeypox disease (MPXD), a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), is an emerging zoonotic disease endemic in some countries of Central and Western Africa but seldom reported outside the affected region. Since May 2022, MPXD has been reported at least in 74 countries globally, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the MPXD outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of July 24, 2022; 92 \% (68/74) of the countries with reported MPXD cases had no historical MPXD case reports. From the One Health perspective, the spread of MPXV in the environment poses a risk not only to humans but also to small mammals and may, ultimately, spread to potent novel host populations. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has been extensively utilized to monitor communicable diseases, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It helped in monitoring infectious disease case-loads as well as specific viral variants circulating in communities. The detection of MPXV DNA in lesion materials (e.g. skin, vesicle fluid, crusts), skin rashes, and various body fluids, including respiratory and nasal secretions, saliva, urine, feces, and semen of infected individuals, supports the possibility of using WBS as an early proxy for the detection of MPXV infections. WBS of MPXV DNA can be used to monitor MPXV activity/trends in sewerage network areas even before detecting laboratory-confirmed clinical cases within a community. However, several factors affect the detection of MPXV in wastewater including, but not limited to, routes and duration time of virus shedding by infected individuals, infection rates in the relevant affected population, environmental persistence, the processes and analytical sensitivity of the used methods. Further research is needed to identify the key factors that impact the detection of MPXV biomarkers in wastewater and improve the utility of WBS of MPXV as an early warning and monitoring tool for safeguarding human health. In this review, we shortly summarize aspects of the MPXV outbreak relevant to wastewater monitoring and discuss the challenges associated with WBS.},

From adversity, opportunities have arisen to measure the state and dynamics of human disease at a scale not seen before.

The scale and pace of this work has proven to be unique in monitoring of virus dynamics at a national level, demonstrating the importance of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for public health protection. Beyond COVID-19, it can provide additional value for monitoring and informing on a range of biological and chemical markers of human health. A discussion of measurement uncertainty associated with surveillance of wastewater, focusing on lessons-learned from the UK programmes monitoring COVID-19 is presented, showing that sources of uncertainty impacting measurement quality and interpretation of data for public health decision-making, are varied and complex. While some factors remain poorly understood, we present approaches taken by the UK programmes to manage and mitigate the more tractable sources of uncertainty. This work provides a platform to integrate uncertainty management into WBE activities as part of global One Health initiatives beyond the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Ecological databases continue to grow in volume, breadth and complexity. Higher level descriptions of data (i.e., metadata) and information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses (i.e., “meta-information” in the broadest sense) are essential for understanding and using the increasingly complex and voluminous data and information. The concepts of meta-information, in general, and metadata, in particular, have evolved in concert with the increasing needs for functionality by the community. From a scientific perspective, metadata may be characterized as having developed from initially supporting data discovery; to facilitating acquisition, comprehension and utilization of data by humans; and, most recently, to beginning to enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis via metadata-enabled scientific workflow systems. The continued conceptual and operational developments in metadata required to support comprehensive automated scientific workflow systems portend many challenges and opportunities. For example, there are significant opportunities for collaboration among ecologists and computer scientists in developing domain-specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies that provide the basis for semantic mediation—the “glue” technologies that enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis. Similarly, there are opportunities for computer scientists and engineers to develop new mechanisms that support automated metadata encoding—such as providing the information that would be necessary to understand the end-to-end flow of sensor data from in situ data collection, streaming through quality assurance filtering, aggregation, transformation and additional processing, analysis, and publication of digital products. As the technologies mature, we still have many sociological barriers to overcome including the needs for increased attention to software usability testing and engineering to enhance user-friendliness of metadata management software, new capital investments in ecological data archives, and increasing the metadata management benefit–cost ratio for the average scientist via incentives and enabling tools.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

Requiring a large number of data samples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively high computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently1 proposed few-shot learning algorithms. Given the learning dynamics and characteristics, the approaches to few-shot learning problems are discussed in the perspectives of meta-learning, transfer learning, and hybrid approaches (i.e., different variations of the few-shot learning problem).},

  author = {Pilotte, Nils},
  institution = {University of Massachusetts Amherst},
  doi = {10.7275/16658820},
  abstract = {Current World Health Organization recommendations for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) rely on antiquated microscopy-based techniques that lack both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. While sufficient for providing rough estimates of infection frequency and intensity within high prevalence settings, these techniques lack the capacity to effectively estimate infection levels following successful intervention efforts, as worm burdens decline and community prevalences decrease. Furthermore, an expanding body of evidence is suggesting that microscopy-based misdiagnosis of infection is likely a larger concern then previously believed. As such, with an increase in programmatic support for transmission interruption and an escalating belief in the possibility of regional eradication, recognition of the need for improved diagnostics is expanding. Such diagnostics are critically important for accurately measuring intervention successes, and for making determinations about where and when interventions can be discontinued allowing for the re-prioritization of resources. Given the stakes and acknowledging this need, recent years have witnessed the growth of molecular diagnostic development efforts, centering primarily upon the creation of real-time PCR-based assays. However, while a variety of assays have been developed, these assays have all utilized suboptimal DNA targets, typically exploiting ribosomal and/or mitochondrial sequences for parasite detection.  By coupling next-generation sequencing with bioinformatics-based approaches to the analysis of raw sequencing read data, the selection of optimal DNA-based molecular targets becomes possible. Software, such as RepeatExplorer can be utilized to identify high copy-number, species-specific, repetitive DNA elements within a pathogen. These repeat sequences can then be utilized to design sensitive and specific real-time PCR assays. Utilizing such an approach, we have designed, developed, and extensively validated a panel of assays facilitating the improved detection of the human infecting STH. These assays are proving useful in a number of settings, gaining widespread traction within the operational research community and helping to shape and define future intervention strategies. Furthermore, our assays continue to highlight the inadequacies of alternative diagnostic methods, illustrating the potential challenges and risks for misdiagnosis associated with the use of both microscopy-based diagnostics, and assays targeting less sensitive, less specific genomic regions.},

Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations.

The data from the last 5-months, representing a range of high and low case counts, was used for this demonstration. The QTA integrated clinical and wastewater virus signals, while combining recommendations from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The key steps in the QTA consisted of signal normalization with pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), as a fecal biomarker, statistical linear break-point trend analysis and integration of both wastewater virus signal and clinical cases trend results. Using this approach, the wastewater virus and clinical cases trends, direction, and magnitude were clearly identified and provided a unified complementary tool to support public health decisions on a targeted, sewershed-specific basis.},

Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1 and N2 gene regions, and E gene) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n~=~250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman's r~=~0.70, p~{$<~$}0.05), with the N2 gene region being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Viral sequencing showed that shifts in strain-defining variants of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples matched those in clinical isolates from the same time periods. The findings from this study support that wastewater surveillance is effective in COVID-19 trend tracking and provide sentinel warning of variant emergence and transmission within various types of communities.},

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a useful tool in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While wastewater surveillance has been applied at various scales to monitor population-level COVID-19 dynamics, there is a need for quantitative metrics to interpret wastewater data in the context of public health trends. 24-hour composite wastewater samples were collected from March 2020 through May 2021 from a Massachusetts wastewater treatment plant and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were measured using RT-qPCR. The relationship between wastewater copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments and COVID-19 clinical cases and deaths varies over time. We demonstrate the utility of three new metrics to monitor changes in COVID-19 epidemiology: (1) the ratio between wastewater copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments and clinical cases (WC ratio), (2) the time lag between wastewater and clinical reporting, and (3) a transfer function between the wastewater and clinical case curves. The WC ratio increases after key events, providing insight into the balance between disease spread and public health response. Time lag and transfer function analysis showed that wastewater data preceded clinically reported cases in the first wave of the pandemic but did not serve as a leading indicator in the second wave, likely due to increased testing capacity, which allows for more timely case detection and reporting. These three metrics could help further integrate wastewater surveillance into the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.},

Although correlation analysis between wastewater surveillance data and the daily clinical COVID-19 case numbers has been frequently conducted, the importance of stationarity of the time series data has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrated that strong yet spurious correlation could arise from non-stationary time series data in wastewater surveillance. Data prewhitening to remove trends by the first differences of values between two consecutive times helped to reveal distinct cross-correlation patterns between daily clinical case numbers and daily wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance during a lockdown period in 2020 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Normalization of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration by the endogenous fecal viral markers in the same samples significantly improved the cross-correlation, and the best correlation was detected at a two-day lag of the daily clinical case numbers. The detection of a significant correlation between the daily wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance and the clinical case numbers also suggests that disease burden fluctuation in the community should not be excluded as a contributor to the often observed weekly cyclic patterns of clinical cases.},

We find that hospital monitoring could have detected COVID-19 in Wuhan 0.4 weeks earlier than it was actually discovered, at 2,300 cases compared to 3,400. Wastewater monitoring would not have accelerated COVID-19 detection in Wuhan, but provides benefit in smaller catchments and for asymptomatic or long-incubation diseases like polio or HIV/AIDS. Monitoring of air travel provides little benefit in most scenarios we evaluated. In sum, early detection systems can substantially mitigate some future pandemics, but would not have changed the course of COVID-19.},

In this study, we present results of a large nationwide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring system in the United States. We profile 55 locations with at least six months of sampling from April 2020 to May 2021. These locations represent more than 12 million individuals across 19 states. Samples were collected approximately weekly by wastewater treatment utilities as part of a regular wastewater surveillance service and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were normalized to pepper mild mottle virus, an indicator of fecal matter in wastewater. We show that wastewater data reflect temporal and geographic trends in clinical COVID-19 cases and investigate the impact of normalization on correlations with case data within and across locations. We also provide key lessons learned from our broad-scale implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology, which can be used to inform wastewater-based epidemiology approaches for future emerging diseases. This work demonstrates that wastewater surveillance is a feasible approach for nationwide population-level monitoring of COVID-19 disease. With an evolving epidemic and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, wastewater-based epidemiology can serve as a passive surveillance approach for detecting changing dynamics or resurgences of the virus.},

Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts. We find that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemiological metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.},

The normalized root-mean square error (NRMSE) is broken down into contributions from the normalized bias (NBias) and the normalized pattern error (NPE). The square of NPE, or the normalized error varianceα, is further analyzed into phase and amplitude errors, measured respectively by the correlation and the variance similarity. The variance similarity diagnostic is introduced to verify variability e.g. under different climates. While centered RMSE can be reduced by under-prediction of variability in the model,αpenalizes over- and under-prediction of variability equally. The error decomposition diagram, the correlation-similarity diagram and the anisotropy diagram are introduced. The correlation-similarity diagram was compared with the Taylor diagram: it has the advantage of analyzing the normalized error variance geometrically into contributions from the correlation and variance similarity. Normalization of the error metrics removes the dependence on the inherent variability of a variable and allows comparison among quantities of different physical units and from different regions and seasons. This method was used to assess the Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS). The NWP performance degrades progressively from the midlatitudes through the sub-tropics to the tropics. But similar cold and moist biases are noted and position and timing errors are the main cause of pattern errors. Although the suite of metrics is applied to NWP verification here, it is generally applicable as diagnostics for differences between two data sets.},

We advocate that these flaws are symptoms of broader and intensifying marketization of academic research. To address this, we first discuss the two dimensions of marketization: the commodification of academic output and the ‘managerialization’ of academic governance. We then argue that sustainability research is especially vulnerable to marketization trends because of its broader set of values that cannot merely be reflected in academic output. We illustrate these values by discussing the nature of the challenges faced by sustainability researchers, their relationships with non-academic stakeholders, and the intrinsic normativity of their research. We explore potential ways forward to reform existing academic organizational structures and research funding system, embrace more inclusive and democratic research approaches, and support the development of nonprofit open-access journals.},

  abstract = {BackgroundWastewater surveillance (WWS) of pathogens is a rapidly evolving field owing to the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, which brought about a paradigm shift in public health authorities for the management of pathogen outbreaks. However, the interpretation of WWS in terms of clinical cases remains a challenge, particularly in small communities where large variations in pathogen concentrations are routinely observed without a clear relation to clinical incident cases.MethodsResults are presented for WWS from six municipalities in the eastern part of Canada during the spring of 2021. We developed a numerical model based on viral kinetics reduction functions to consider both prevalent and incident cases to interpret the WWS data in light of the reported clinical cases in the six surveyed communities.ResultsThe use of the proposed numerical model with a viral kinetics reduction function drastically increased the interpretability of the WWS data in terms of the clinical cases reported for the surveyed community. In line with our working hypothesis, the effects of viral kinetics reduction modeling were more important in small communities than in larger communities. In all but one of the community cases (where it had no effect), the use of the proposed numerical model led to a change from a +1.5\% (for the larger urban center, Quebec City) to a +48.8\% increase in the case of a smaller community (Drummondville).ConclusionConsideration of prevalent and incident cases through the proposed numerical model increases the correlation between clinical cases and WWS data. This is particularly the case in small communities. Because the proposed model is based on a biological mechanism, we believe it is an inherent part of any wastewater system and, hence, that it should be used in any WWS analysis where the aim is to relate WWS measurement to clinical cases.},

The objective of this study was to achieve SNR, either via partial nitritation/anammox (PNA) or partial denitrification/anammox (PdNA), simultaneously with biological phosphorus removal in a process with upstream carbon capture. This study took place in a pilot scale A/B process with a sidestream bio-P reactor and tertiary anammox polishing. Despite low influent rbCOD concentrations from the A-stage effluent, bio-P occurred in the B-stage thanks to the addition of A-stage WAS fermentate to the sidestream reactor. Nitrite accumulation occurred in the B-stage via partial denitrification and partial nitritation (NOB out-selection), depending on operational conditions, and was removed along with ammonia by the tertiary anammox MBBR, with the ability to achieve effluent TIN less than 2 mg/L. Practitioner Points A sidestream reactor with sufficient fermentate addition enables biological phosphorus removal in a B-stage system with little-to-no influent VFA. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal is not inhibited by intermittent aeration and is stable at a wide range of process SRTs. Partial nitritation and partial denitrification are viable routes to produce nitrite within an A/B process with sidestream bio-P, for downstream anammox in a polishing MBBR.},

Wastewater treatment processes are large, complex processes, with multiple controlling mechanisms, a high degree of disturbance variability and non-linear (generally stable) behavior with multiple internal recycle loops. Semi-mechanistic biochemical models currently dominate research and application, with data-driven deep learning models emerging as an alternative and supplementary approach. But these modelling approaches have grown in separate communities of research and practice, and so there is limited appreciation of the strengths, weaknesses, contrasts and similarities between the methods. This review addresses that gap by providing a detailed guide to deep learning methods and their application to wastewater process modelling. The review is aimed at wastewater modelling experts who are familiar with established mechanistic modelling approach, and are curious about the opportunities and challenges afforded by deep learning methods. We conclude with a discussion and needs analysis on the value of different ways of modelling wastewater processes and open research problems.},

Despite the progress in the field of data acquisition systems, sensors are subject to malfunctions that can bias the evaluation of the pollution flow. It is therefore essential to identify potential anomalies in the data before any use. The objective of this work is to deploy artificial intelligence tools to automate the data validation and to assess the added value of this approach in assisting the validation performed by an operator. To do so, we compare two state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on turbidity data in a sewer network. On the one hand, we conclude that the One-class SVM model is not adapted to the nature of the studied data which is heterogeneous and noisy. The Matrix Profile model, on the other hand, provides promising results with a majority of anomalies detected and a relatively limited number of false positives. By comparing these results to the expert validation, it turns out that the use of the Matrix Profile model objectifies and accelerates the validation task while maintaining the same level of performance compared to the annotator agreement rate between two experts.},

  abstract = {In an emergency epidemic response, data providers supply data on a best-faith effort to modellers and analysts who are typically the end user of data collected for other primary purposes such as to inform patient care. Thus, modellers who analyse secondary data have limited ability to influence what is captured. During an emergency response, models themselves are often under constant development and require both stability in their data inputs and flexibility to incorporate new inputs as novel data sources become available. This dynamic landscape is challenging to work with. Here we outline a data pipeline used in the ongoing COVID-19 response in the UK that aims to address these issues. A data pipeline is a sequence of steps to carry the raw data through to a processed and useable model input, along with the appropriate metadata and context. In ours, each data type had an individual processing report, designed to produce outputs that could be easily combined and used downstream. Automated checks were in-built and added as new pathologies emerged. These cleaned outputs were collated at different geographic levels to provide standardised datasets. Finally, a human validation step was an essential component of the analysis pathway and permitted more nuanced issues to be captured. This framework allowed the pipeline to grow in complexity and volume and facilitated the diverse range of modelling approaches employed by researchers. Additionally, every report or modelling output could be traced back to the specific data version that informed it ensuring reproducibility of results. Our approach has been used to facilitate fast-paced analysis and has evolved over time. Our framework and its aspirations are applicable to many settings beyond COVID-19 data, for example for other outbreaks such as Ebola, or where routine and regular analyses are required.},

However, the multi-optimization approach applied to WWTPs has been inadequate, resulting in a low optimization performance owing to varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables. Therefore, this study developed a digital multi-solution for optimal operation of a WWTP based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Dynamic influent conditions with low, normal, and high influent chemical oxygen demands and total nitrogen composition ratios were generated using a k-means clustering algorithm to accurately reflect operating conditions. A game abstraction method based on a two-stage attention network (G2ANet) algorithm was employed to simultaneously search for three operational setpoints: dissolved oxygen, external sludge recycling, and external carbon dose. The adaptability of the G2ANet-based digital multi-solution for determining setpoints was evaluated by employing newly measured one-year influent data. The results demonstrated the ability of an intelligent G2ANet-based digital multi-solution in identifying optimal setpoints to improve the performance of WWTPs and outperform manual operating systems under varying influent conditions. It reduced aeration energy by 25~\% and improved effluent quality by 7~\%, while maintaining a similar pumping energy. The G2ANet-based digital multi-solution can innovatively contribute to the smart operation of WWTP operation systems owing to its environmental stability and adaptability.},

For complex physical systems, effective digital integration can often be achieved by means of a system of aggregated digital twins coupled with a services network. Designing such a system of digital twins and services involves a daunting array of options and considerations. This paper presents a design framework that facilitates systematic, effective decisions when designing a system of digital twins to integrate the data from a complex physical system. The design framework is arranged in six steps: 1) needs and constraints analysis, 2) physical system decomposition, 3) services allocation, 4) performance and quality considerations, 5) implementation considerations and 6) verification and validation. The design framework works with a general reference architecture that combines a digital twin aggregation hierarchy with a service-oriented architecture. This reference architecture allows for the separation of concerns, computational load distribution, incremental development and modular software design. The paper considers the merits of the design framework using two illustrative case studies, i.e. a heliostat field and a smart city. The case studies indicate that the design framework can be applied to a wide range of complex systems and can improve the effectiveness of the design process.},

They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.},

The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.},

The complex biological reactions, unforeseen microbial behaviours, lack of reliable on-line instrumentation, complex modelling, lack of visualize techniques, low-quality industrial measurements and highly time-varying intensive data-driven operations call for the intelligence techniques and operations. The study is a review of sustainable circularity and intelligent data-driven operations and control of the wastewater treatment plant. Water surveillance and monitoring, circular economy and sustainability, automation pyramid, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, data pipeline, digital twin, data mining, and data-driven visualization, cyber-physical systems and water-energy-health management were reviewed. The deployment of the digital systems has evidently proven to bridges the gap between the data-driven soft sensor, operation and control systems in WWTP. Accurate prediction of the WWTP variables can support process design and control, reduce operation cost, improve system reliability, predictive maintenance and troubleshooting, increase water quality, increase stakeholder's engagement and endorse optimization of the plant performance. This procures the best compliance with international standards and diversification. The inclusion of life cycle environmental or cost management technologies in optimization models is an interesting pathway towards sustainable water treatment in-line with sustainable development goals, circular bioeconomy and industry 4.0.},

Despite the successful application of mechanistic models in the water sector, they show some important limitations and do not fully profit from the increasing digitalisation of systems and processes. Recent advances in data-driven methods have provided options for harnessing the power of Industry 4.0, but they are often limited by the lack of interpretability and extrapolation capabilities. Hybrid modelling (HM) combines these two modelling paradigms and aims to leverage both the rapidly increasing volumes of data collected, as well as the continued pursuit of greater process understanding. Despite the potential of HM in a sector that is undergoing a significant digital and cultural transformation, the application of hybrid models remains vague. This article presents an overview of HM methodologies applied to WRRFs and aims to stimulate the wider adoption and development of HM. We also highlight challenges and research needs for HM design and architecture, good modelling practice, data assurance, and software compatibility. HM is a paradigm for WRRF modelling to transition towards a more resource-efficient, resilient, and sustainable future.},

We identify smart water research trends over time, relationships with climate adaptation and mitigation goals, and applicability to places with developed or developing water and electrical infrastructure. To do so, we systematically review the literature, identifying research on Information Communication Technology-enabled technologies related to water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. We assess the relationship between each study and climate adaptation and mitigation objectives: managing greater variation in water quantity, leading to scarcity and increased stormwater; managing declining water quality; and low-carbon water systems. We find 96 relevant studies and identify five major categories of research addressing climate adaptation and mitigation: monitoring, modeling, system design, system feedbacks, and uptake and implementation. We find there is a recent acceleration in smart water research, with a concentration of studies focused on modeling. There is an emphasis on water efficiency using data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which is most applicable to cities with developed water grids and consistent electrical supplies. Secondarily, there is a concentration of work using distributed sensors for early detection of water quality degradation, which is being done in all municipal contexts. There is far less research on uptake and implementation of smart approaches, especially at the institutional level. In addition, there is relatively little work that explicitly relates smart water technologies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While smart water approaches are applicable everywhere, there is a need to for expanded focus on areas without developed water grids or consistent electricity for smart water to meaningfully contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 6.},

  abstract = {Water treatment researchers will maximize insights from data by implementing FAIR and Open (FAIR/O) principles for data storage and management. Progress toward domain-specific FAIR/O data infrastructure and practices advance data synthesizability, data extensibility, and stakeholder diversity. Embracing FAIR/O data principles in domain research would enable data-driven research breakthroughs that benefit a diverse array of water treatment research stakeholders. These breakthroughs arise from increased data density to improve research scope, better cross-mode data translation between experimental and modeling research outputs, and improved multiscale data integration to answer key questions across research scales. This paper addresses the gap between the current state of data sharing and the envisioned potential of FAIR/O data by offering practical steps toward building effective and sustainable water treatment data infrastructure, engaging key stakeholders, and motivating their participation. We clarify essential activities of a water treatment research data repository and suggest opportunities for communicating and growing its value.},

  abstract = {Providing and distributing fresh water to large communities is a major global concern. In addition to its scarcity as well as to its wastage, this vital resource is being affected by challenging environmental conditions. New approaches are, therefore, urgently needed for an optimized, fair, and efficient use of fresh water. The adoption of emergent technologies is giving high hopes to reach this objective. Among these technologies, digital twin is attracting increasing attention from the academic and industrial committees. This attention is particularly motivated by its expected values to any sector, including process optimization, cost reduction, and time to market shortening. In the specific field of water management, several solutions are being proposed, especially to detect leak detection and test water assets under a variety of working constraints. These solutions are still lacking intelligence and autonomy throughout the loop of data acquisition and processing as well as asset control and service generation and delivery. To this end, we are proposing in this paper a new framework based on multi-agent systems and DT paradigm to close gaps within this loop. Our multi-agent system is responsible of running data analytics mechanisms in order to assess water consumption and generate relevant feedbacks to users using, among others, a rewarding system to select the appropriate pricing policies. It is also responsible of simulating asset operations under specific working constraints for the purpose of failure and/or defect detection.},

Indicatively, the use of sensors, Internet of Things, machine learning, and big data analytics has been catalyzing smart water management. With two-thirds of the global population to be living in urban areas by 2050, this research focuses on the impact of digitization on sustainable urban water management. More specifically, existing scientific literature studies were explored for providing meaningful insights on smart water technologies implemented in urban contexts, emphasizing supply and distribution networks. The review analysis outcomes were classified according to three main pillars identified: (i) level of analysis (i.e., municipal or residential/industrial); (ii) technology used (e.g., sensors, algorithms); and (iii) research scope/focus (e.g., monitoring, optimization), with the use of a systematic approach. Overall, this study is expected to act as a methodological tool and guiding map of the most pertinent state-of-the-art research efforts to integrate digitalization in the field of water stewardship and improve urban sustainability.},

Water resources in Jordan comprise of conventional resources (ground water and surface water) and non-conventional resources mainly treated wastewater. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to provide predictions for the quality of treated effluent from Wadi Arab wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-Phase1. This plant serves South-West of Irbid city. The treated effluent of Wadi Arab WWTP is used for irrigation. Four ANN models were developed to predict effluent quality of Wadi Arab WWTP-Phase1, namely BOD5, COD, SS, NH4-N. A systematic approach was employed to find the most appropriate architecture for each ANN model. The influent flow rate (Q), Temperature, pH, BOD5, COD, SS and NH4-N were the input quality parameters for each ANN model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to uncover the prediction uncertainty of an ANN model to variations in each input parameter. The analyses showed that all four ANN models were highly sensitive to influent pH,while all were slightly sensitive to influent SS. This study found that ANN models were reasonably robust and they could be used to alert plant staff of future problems such as those indicated in the above scenarios. The results showed that ANN models are beneficial to manage the treatment process in Wadi Arab WWTP, to produce effluent quality within the Jordanian Standards for irrigation, and to protect the ecosystem in the Jordan Valley.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions account for the majority of the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Many N2O mitigation strategies have since been developed while a holistic view is still missing. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of N2O mitigation studies in wastewater treatment. Through analyzing existing studies, this article presents the essential knowledge to guide N2O mitigations, and the logics behind mitigation strategies. In practice, mitigations are mainly carried out by aeration control, feed scheme optimization, and process optimization. Despite increasingly more studies, real implementation remains rare, which is a combined result of unclear climate change policies/incentives, as well as technical challenges. Five critical technical challenges, as well as opportunities, of N2O mitigations were identified. It is proposed that (i) quantification methods for overall N2O emissions and pathway contributions need improvement; (ii) a reliable while straightforward mathematical model is required to quantify benefits and compare mitigation strategies; (iii) tailored risk assessment needs to be conducted for WWTPs, in which more long-term full-scale trials of N2O mitigation are urgently needed to enable robust assessments of the resulting operational costs and impact on nutrient removal performance; (iv) current mitigation strategies focus on centralized WWTPs, more investigations are warranted for decentralised systems, especially decentralized activated sludge WWTPs; and (v) N2O may be mitigated by adopting novel strategies promoting N2O reduction denitrification or microorganisms that emit less N2O. Overall, we conclude N2O mitigation research is reaching a maturity while challenges still exist for a wider implementation, especially in relation to the reliability of N2O mitigation strategies and potential risks to nutrient removal performances of WWTPs.},

For infrastructure asset management (IAM) planning those data need to be processed and transformed into information. However, information management efficiency often falls short of desired results. This happens particularly in municipalities where management is structured according to local government models. Along with the existing IS at the utilities' disposal, engineers and managers take their decisions based on information that is often incomplete, inaccurate or out-of-date. One of the main challenges faced by asset managers is integrating the several, often conflicting, sources of information available on the infrastructure, its condition and performance, and the various predictive analyses that can assist in prioritizing projects or interventions. This paper presents an overview of the IS used by Portuguese water utilities and discusses how data from different IS can be integrated in order to support IAM.},

  abstract = {Water quality deterioration in drinking water systems (i.e., system failure) causing serious outbreaks have frequently been happening around the world. These failures can be predicted through a real-time drinking water quality monitoring system for timely actions. Although Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) has been commonly used for this purpose, this system suffers considerable limitations, such as the scalability of sensors, lack of predictive ability, and increased burden on operators overwhelmed by superfluous notifications. Proficient artificial intelligence \& soft computing (AI \& SC) techniques and cloud Internet of Things (IoT) may significantly reduce the reliance on operators and eventually improve system operations. This study critically reviewed the literature published from 2000 to 2020 to evaluate AI \& SC applications’ trends in drinking water quality management while developing a roadmap for autonomous digital water quality management. The investigation reveals that AI \& SC were primarily used for assessing drinking and surface water quality. These techniques were largely applied to effectively predict, evaluate, and control water quality. AI \& SC were also used to model physicochemical (basic and complex) and microbiological parameters. The most commonly applied AI \& SC techniques are the multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network, general regression neural network, support vector machine, Bayesian networks, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. Additional articles published after 2020 were also reviewed to compare with the measures proposed in the roadmap. This roadmap guides water utilities, policy-makers, and regulators to achieve reliable water quality in a smart and efficient manner.},

Currently, RT-qPCR assays is been developed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA specimen clinical testing and detection in the water system. Convectional wastewater treatment methods and disinfection are expected to eradicate the SAR-CoV-2. Chlorine, UV radiation, ozone, chloramine is been used to inactivate and disinfect the water treatment system against the SARS-CoV-2.

The research aimed to develop a water quality safety prediction model for drinking water source areas in Three Gorges Reservoir and simulate pollutant distribution in water bodies under pollution accident conditions. In this study, a new algorithm of two-dimensional water quantity model was proposed, which incorporated Digital Elevation Model as a computational grid into the Geographic Information System. By comparing the water quality observed values with the predicted values of the study area in 2014, the relative error was less than 6\%, the model can be applied in a reasonable range. Furthermore, this study assumed a pollution accident that the Huangjuedu drinking water source area was polluted by TP pollution (level V) of 0.4\,mg/L. Based on the statistical annual date of Zhutuo hydrological station in 2016 (as blank group), dispatching test that was conducted by increasing discharge flow of Xiangjia Dam Reservoir. The results shows that the water velocity of intake increased with discharge flow of Xiangjia Dam Reservoir, and that the maximum water velocity was 2.051\,m/s. The pollutant concentration of HDWSA intake decreased rapidly with the increase of the discharge flow. When the discharge flow was 0\,m3/s, the concentration of intake reached the level III water quality standard after 127.8\,min. When the discharge flow was 12,000\,m3/s, the concentration of intake reached the level III water quality standard after 116.7\,min. In the dispatching test, the rate of migration and diffusion of the pollutant to the lower reaches was greatly affected by the discharge flow of Xiangjia Dam Reservoir. The model could predict the water velocity and pollutant concentrations at the intake, as well as temporal-spatial distributions of pollutants in the whole water source area. Prediction results of the model were helpful for management departments to predict grasp the change of pollutions timely and accurately, and make corresponding plans under accident conditions.},

  abstract = {The potential of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a surveillance and early warning tool for the COVID-19 outbreak has been demonstrated. For areas with limited testing capacity, wastewater surveillance can provide information on the disease dynamic at a community level. A predictive model is a key to generating quantitative estimates of the infected population. Modeling longitudinal wastewater data can be challenging as biomarkers in wastewater are susceptible to variations caused by multiple factors associated with the wastewater matrix and the sewersheds characteristics. As WBE is an emerging trend, the model should be able to address the uncertainties of wastewater from different sewersheds. We proposed exploiting machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are supported by the growing WBE data. In this article, we reviewed the existing predictive models, among which the emerging machine learning/deep learning models showed great potential. However, most models are built for individual sewersheds with few features extracted from the wastewater. To fulfill the research gap, we compared different time-series and non-time-series models for their short-term predictive performance of COVID-19 cases in 9 diverse sewersheds. The time-series models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and Prophet, outcompeted the non-time-series models. Besides viral (SARS-CoV-2) loads and location identity, domain-specific features like biochemical parameters of wastewater, geographical parameters of the sewersheds, and some socioeconomic parameters of the communities can contribute to the models. With proper feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, we believe machine learning models like LSTM can be a feasible solution for the COVID-19 trend prediction via WBE. Overall, this is a proof-of-concept study on the application of machine learning in COVID-19 WBE. Future studies are needed to deploy and maintain the model in more real-world applications.},

  abstract = {A viral outbreak is a global challenge that affects public health and safety. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that has not been yet implemented in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using WBE, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits available data from reliable sources to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks. The proposed framework could provide early detection of viruses, forecast risk maps and vulnerable areas, and estimate the number of infected citizens.},

It is crucial to have a reliable and population-wide prediction tool for estimating COVID-19-induced hospital admissions. We evaluated the feasibility of using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to predict COVID-19-induced weekly new hospitalizations in 159 counties across 45 states in the United States of America (USA), covering a population of nearly 100 million. Using county-level weekly wastewater surveillance data (over 20 months), WBE-based models were established through the random forest algorithm. WBE-based models accurately predicted the county-level weekly new admissions, allowing a preparation window of 1-4 weeks. In real applications, periodically updated WBE-based models showed good accuracy and transferability, with mean absolute error within 4-6 patients/100k population for upcoming weekly new hospitalization numbers. Our study demonstrated the potential of using WBE as an effective method to provide early warnings for healthcare systems. Wastewater-based epidemiology is increasingly used to predict disease occurrence. Here, the authors use SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater in machine learning models to predict COVID-19 related hospitalisation in the United States.},

  abstract = {Monitoring COVID-19 infection cases has been a singular focus of many policy makers and communities. However, direct monitoring through testing has become more onerous for a number of reasons, such as costs, delays, and personal choices. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable tool for monitoring disease prevalence and dynamics to supplement direct monitoring. The objective of this study is to intelligently incorporate WBE information to nowcast and forecast new weekly COVID-19 cases and to assess the efficacy of such WBE information for these tasks in an interpretable manner. The methodology consists of a time-series based machine learning (TSML) strategy that can extract deeper knowledge and insights from temporal structured WBE data in the presence of other relevant temporal variables, such as minimum ambient temperature and water temperature, to boost the capability for predicting new weekly COVID-19 case numbers. The results confirm that feature engineering and machine learning can be utilized to enhance the performance and interpretability of WBE for COVID-19 monitoring, along with identifying the different recommended features to be applied for short-term and long-term nowcasting and short-term and long-term forecasting. The conclusion of this research is that the proposed time-series ML methodology performs as well, and sometimes better, than simple predictions that assume available and accurate COVID-19 case numbers from extensive monitoring and testing. Overall, this paper provides an insight into the prospects of machine learning based WBE to the researchers and decision-makers as well as public health practitioners for predicting and preparing the next wave of COVID-19 or the next pandemic.},

  abstract = {Humans rely on clean water for their health, well-being, and various socio-economic activities. During the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant reminder of about the importance of hygiene and sanitation for public health. The most common approach to securing clean water supplies for this purpose is via wastewater treatment. To date, an effective method of detecting wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) accurately and automatically via remote sensing is unavailable. In this paper, we provide a solution to this task by proposing a novel joint deep learning (JDL) method that consists of a fine-tuned object detection network and a multi-task residual attention network (RAN). By leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) and multimodal remote sensing (RS) data, our JDL method is able to simultaneously tackle two different tasks: land use land cover (LULC) and WWTP classification. Moreover, JDL exploits the complementary effects between these tasks for a performance gain. We train JDL using 4,187 WWTP features and 4,200 LULC samples and validate the performance of the proposed method over a selected area around Stuttgart with 723 WWTP features and 1,200 LULC samples to generate an LULC classification map and a WWTP detection map. Extensive experiments conducted with different comparative methods demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our JDL method in automatic WWTP detection in comparison with single-modality/single-task or traditional survey methods. Moreover, lessons learned pave the way for future works to simultaneously and effectively address multiple large-scale mapping tasks (e.g., both mapping LULC and detecting WWTP) from multimodal RS data via deep learning.},

In these situations, machine learning algorithms fail to achieve substantial efficacy while predicting these under-represented instances. To solve this problem, many variations of synthetic minority over-sampling methods (SMOTE) have been proposed to balance the dataset which deals with continuous features. However, for datasets with both nominal and continuous features, SMOTE-NC is the only SMOTE-based over-sampling technique to balance the data. In this paper, we present a novel minority over-sampling method, SMOTE-ENC (SMOTE - Encoded Nominal and Continuous), in which, nominal features are encoded as numeric values and the difference between two such numeric value reflects the amount of change of association with minority class. Our experiments show that the classification model using SMOTE-ENC method offers better prediction than model using SMOTE-NC when the dataset has a substantial number of nominal features and also when there is some association between the categorical features and the target class. Additionally, our proposed method addressed one of the major limitations of SMOTE-NC algorithm. SMOTE-NC can be applied only on mixed datasets that have features consisting of both continuous and nominal features and cannot function if all the features of the dataset are nominal. Our novel method has been generalized to be applied on both mixed datasets and on nominal only datasets. The code is available from mkhushi.github.io},

The operation of such a system must be managed effectively for sustainable water supply to satisfy the growing consumer demand. This creates a need for intelligent systems for the purposes of operational management. In recent years, computing technologies have been applied to water systems to assist water utilities in addressing some of these problems. Unfortunately, previous ICT solutions have not been able to provide the necessary support for applications to deal with the dynamics of water supply system environments.

Thus, a new industrial revolution in the water context (Water 4.0) is being researched. This is referred to as Water 4.0, which offers better possibilities to enhance the sustainability of water supply system operations. This paper presents an overview of Water 4.0 and its applications in enhancing water supply system operations. Key features of Water 4.0 are discussed.

  abstract = {Wastewater monitoring and epidemiology have seen renewed interest during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there is an increasing need to normalize wastewater-derived viral loads in local populations. Chemical tracers, both exogenous and endogenous compounds, have proven to be more stable and reliable for normalization than biological indicators. However, differing instrumentation and extraction methods can make it difficult to compare results. This review examines current extraction and quantification methods for ten common population indicators: creatinine, coprostanol, nicotine, cotinine, sucralose, acesulfame, androstenedione 5-hydroindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), caffeine, and 1,7-dimethyluric acid. Some wastewater parameters such as ammonia, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and daily flowrate were also evaluated. The analytical methods included direct injection, dilute and shoot, liquid/liquid, and solid phase extraction (SPE). Creatine, acesulfame, nicotine, 5-HIAA and androstenedione have been analysed by direct injection into LC-MS; however, most authors prefer to include SPE steps to avoid matrix effects. Both LC-MS and GC-MS have been successfully used to quantify coprostanol in wastewater, and the other selected indicators have been quantified successfully with LC-MS. Acidification to stabilize the sample before freezing to maintain the integrity of samples has been reported to be beneficial. However, there are arguments both for and against working at acidic pHs. Wastewater parameters mentioned earlier are quick and easy to quantify, but the data does not always represent the human population effectively. A preference for population indicators originating solely from humans is apparent. This review summarises methods employed for chemical indicators in wastewater, provides a basis for choosing an appropriate extraction and analysis method, and highlights the utility of accurate chemical tracer data for wastewater-based epidemiology.},

As shedding of infectious virus is required for onward transmission, understanding shedding characteristics is relevant for public health interventions. Viral shedding is influenced by biological characteristics of the virus, host factors and pre-existing immunity (previous infection or vaccination) of the infected individual. Although the process of human-to-human transmission is multifactorial, viral load substantially contributed to human-to-human transmission, with higher viral load posing a greater risk for onward transmission. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have further complicated the picture of virus shedding. As underlying immunity in the population through previous infection, vaccination or a combination of both has rapidly increased on a global scale after almost 3 years of the pandemic, viral shedding patterns have become more distinct from those of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that influence infectious virus shedding and the period during which individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are contagious is crucial to guide public health measures and limit transmission. Furthermore, diagnostic tools to demonstrate the presence of infectious virus from routine diagnostic specimens are needed.},

However, big data in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is widely underutilized, due in part to a workforce that lacks background knowledge of data science required to fully analyze the unique characteristics of WWTP. Wastewater treatment processes exhibit nonlinear, nonstationary, autocorrelated, and co-correlated behavior that (i) is very difficult to model using first principals and (ii) must be considered when implementing data-driven methods. This review provides an overview of data-driven methods of achieving fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced control of WWTP. We present how big data has been used in the context of WWTP, and much of the discussion can also be applied to water treatment. Due to the assumptions inherent in different data-driven modeling approaches (e.g., control charts, statistical process control, model predictive control, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy logic), not all methods are appropriate for every goal or every dataset. Practical guidance is given for matching a desired goal with a particular methodology along with considerations regarding the assumed data structure.

  abstract = {In this work, a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical-machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment. Aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Ammonia-based aeration control (ABAC) is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor, which is the conventional aeration control approach. We propose a quantitative stability metric, Total Sample Variance, to compare system-wide variability of competing aeration control strategies. Using this metric, the performance of traditional DO and ABAC control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium-sized WWTP, and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility. To further improve ABAC performance, ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system. Diurnal, diurnal-linear, artificial neural network (ANN), and hybrid diurnal-linear-ANN forecasting models were trained on real-time plant-wide process data. The diurnal-linear and diurnal-linear-ANN forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia; improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32\% and 46\%, respectively, whereas the ANN model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8\%. This work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional WWTP for features in full-scale conventional activated sludge systems.},

  abstract = {The wastewater used for experimental research is typically collected from a wastewater treatment plant or prepared as a synthetic solution in the lab. These options represent transportation and cost challenges, respectively, particularly for experiments requiring large volumes of wastewater. Here, we describe a method for creating inexpensive synthetic wastewater from readily available household products. The base solution, synthesized by soaking dog food pellets for 24 hours and straining the solution, had average nutrient values of 9.7 mg/L ammonia as N, 12.2 mg/L nitrate as N, 227 mg/L total nitrogen, and 4870 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (COD). Degradation tests demonstrated that soluble COD was biodegradable. The base solution was then used to prepare synthetic wastewater that met the requirements for two experimental applications; (1) anaerobic treatment of primary effluent and (2) land-application treatment of secondary effluent. Cost analysis indicated that the single-ingredient synthetic wastewater cost 92\% less to produce than synthetic wastewater recipes that used laboratory chemicals, and reduced preparation time. These results demonstrated that use of commercial products can simplify the wastewater synthesis process and reduce experimental costs for large-volume research applications while still maintaining consistent wastewater characterization.},

Although there is an increasing concern about the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in natural environments and urban/domestic wastewater, anticancer drugs used in chemotherapy and anticancer medication have received less attention. In this review, the occurrence, environmental persistence, and known and potential ecological impacts of anticancer drugs is discussed. This review shows that these compounds are being increasingly detected in effluents of hospitals, influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants, river surface water and sediments, groundwater, and even drinking water. Anticancer drugs can impact aquatic organisms such as algae, crustaceans, rotifers, and fish and may promote changes in soil and water microbial communities that may alter ecosystem functioning. Our knowledge of technologies for the removal of anticancer drugs is still limited, and these drugs can be dispersed in nature in a diffuse way in an uncontrolled manner. For this reason, an improved understanding of the presence, persistence, and ecological impacts of anticancer drugs in wastewater and natural environments is needed to help design management strategies, protect aquatic microorganisms, and mitigate potential ecological impacts.},

  abstract = {We establish a direct connection between scattering amplitudes in planar four-dimensional theories and a remarkable mathematical structure known as the positive Grassmannian. The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way. On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet singularities. The Grassmannian representation of on-shell processes also gives a new understanding of the all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes, presenting all integrands in a novel dLog form which directly reflects the underlying positive structure.},

We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S\&P500, the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models.},

  abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting problems often contain a complex mix of inputs -- including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed historically -- without any prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

Influent generator (IG) models are used to provide relevant input time series for dynamic WRRF simulations used in these applications. Current IG models found in literature are calibrated on the basis of a single performance criterion, such as the mean percentage error or the root mean square error. This results in the IG being adequate on average but with a lack of representativeness of, for instance, the observed temporal variability of the dataset. However, adequately capturing influent variability may be important for certain types of WRRF optimization, e.g., reaction to peak loads, control system performance evaluation, etc. Therefore, in this study, a data-driven IG model is developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and is optimized by a multi-objective genetic algorithm for both mean percentage error and variability. Hence, the influent generator model is able to generate a time series with a probability distribution that better represents reality, thus giving a better influent description for WRRF design and operation. To further increase the variability of the generated time series and in this way approximate the true variability better, the model is extended with a random walk process.},

In particular, it is shown how cultural theory can be used to refurbish Dahl's theory of pluralist democracy and provide a simple (and visual) metric of deliberative quality in governance. Matters of re-engineering the water-nutrient infrastructures of the city of Atlanta within the Chattahoochee watershed in the southeastern USA provide the primary setting for eventually applying the resulting conceptual framework. Drawing together a somewhat eclectic mix of past experience and prospective approaches – ranging from practical resolutions of water conflicts in Nepal, lessons learned from previous community engagement in the Atlanta–Chattahoochee system, and two stagings of the sustainability agora of the International Water Association – a cultural theory-inspired programme of work is developed to explore and assemble those elements of governance that should, in practice, enable the re-engineering needed for a city to become a force for good in its environment.},

  abstract = {Activated Sludge Models are widely used for simulation-based evaluation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) performance. However, due to the high workload and cost of a measuring campaign on a full-scale WWTP, many simulation studies suffer from lack of sufficiently long influent flow rate and concentration time series representing realistic wastewater influent dynamics. In this paper, a simple phenomenological modelling approach is proposed as an alternative to generate dynamic influent pollutant disturbance scenarios. The presented set of models is constructed following the principles of parsimony (limiting the number of parameters as much as possible), transparency (using parameters with physical meaning where possible) and flexibility (easily extendable to other applications where long dynamic influent time series are needed). The proposed approach is sub-divided in four main model blocks: 1) model block for flow rate generation, 2) model block for pollutants generation (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), 3) model block for temperature generation and 4) model block for transport of water and pollutants. The paper is illustrated with the results obtained during the development of the dynamic influent of the Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 (BSM2). The series of simulations show that it is possible to generate a dry weather influent describing diurnal flow rate dynamics (low rate at night, high rate during day time), weekend effects (with different flow rate during weekends, compared to weekdays), holiday effects (where the wastewater production is assumed to be different for a number of weeks) and seasonal effects (with variations in the infiltration and thus also the flow rate to the WWTP). In addition, the dry weather model can be extended with a rain and storm weather generator, where the proposed phenomenological model can also mimic the “first flush” effect from the sewer network and the influent dilution phenomena that are typically observed at full-scale WWTPs following a rain event. Finally, the extension of the sewer~system can be incorporated in the influent dynamics as well: the larger the simulated sewer network, the smoother the simulated diurnal flow rate and concentration variations. In the discussion, it is pointed out how the proposed phenomenological models can be expanded to other applications, for example to represent heavy metal or organic micro-pollutant loads entering the treatment plant.},

  abstract = {Given the huge number of chemicals released into the environment and existing time and budget constraints, there is a need to prioritize chemicals for risk assessment and monitoring in the context of the European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD). This study is the first to assess the risk of 500 organic substances based on observations in the four European river basins of the Elbe, Scheldt, Danube and Llobregat. A decision tree is introduced that first classifies chemicals into six categories depending on the information available, which allows water managers to focus on the next steps (e.g. derivation of Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), improvement of analytical methods, etc.). The priority within each category is then evaluated based on two indicators, the Frequency of Exceedance and the Extent of Exceedance of Predicted No-Effect Concentrations (PNECs). These two indictors are based on maximum environmental concentrations (MEC), rather than the commonly used statistically based averages (Predicted Effect Concentration, PEC), and compared to the lowest acute-based (PNECacute) or chronic-based thresholds (PNECchronic). For 56\% of the compounds, PNECs were available from existing risk assessments, and the majority of these PNECs were derived from chronic toxicity data or simulated ecosystem studies (mesocosm) with rather low assessment factors. The limitations of this concept for risk assessment purposes are discussed. For the remainder, provisional PNECs (P-PNECs) were established from read-across models for acute toxicity to the standard test organisms Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas and Selenastrum capricornutum. On the one hand, the prioritization revealed that about three-quarter of the 44 substances with MEC/PNEC ratios above ten were pesticides. On the other hand, based on the monitoring data used in this study, no risk with regard to the water phase could be found for eight of the 41 priority substances, indicating a first success of the implementation of the WFD in the investigated river basins.},

An extensive sampling campaign, including ten municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of France over a 20-week period, encompassing the second peak of COVID-19 outbreak in France. A well-recognised ultrafiltration – RNA extraction – RT-qPCR protocol was used and qualified, showing 5.5 +/− 0.5\% recovery yield on heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Importantly the whole, solid and liquid, fraction of wastewater was used for virus concentration in this study. Campaign results showed medium- to strong- correlation between SARS-CoV-2 WBE data and COVID-19 prevalence. To go further, statistical relationships between WWTP inlet flow rate and rainfall were studied and taken into account for each WWTP in order to calculate contextualized SARS-CoV-2 loads. This metric presented improved correlation strengths with COVID-19 prevalence for WWTP particularly submitted and sensitive to rain. Such findings highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 WBE data ultimately require to be contextualized for relevant interpretation.},

All countries in the region have been impacted, and more than 1.5 million people have died. With its relentless social and economic consequences, COVID-19 threatens to undo recent decades of progress on health outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean and diverts attention from work on remaining health sector challenges. This report explores the value, potential, and challenges of wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America and the Caribbean, including in areas without a sanitary sewerage system. Providing examples from across the world, the report also outlines what countries should consider in creating a national wastewater surveillance program as part of their broader efforts to control the impacts of COVID-19.},

Learning from methods to track community spread of other viruses such as poliovirus, environmental virologists and those in the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) field quickly adapted their existing methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Unlike COVID-19 case and mortality data, there was not a global dashboard to track wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA worldwide. This study provides a 1-year review of the “COVIDPoops19” global dashboard of universities, sites, and countries monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Methods to assemble the dashboard combined standard literature review, Google Form submissions, and daily, social media keyword searches. Over 200 universities, 1400 sites, and 55 countries with 59 dashboards monitored wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, monitoring was primarily in high-income countries (65\%) with less access to this valuable tool in low- and middle-income countries (35\%). Data were not widely shared publicly or accessible to researchers to further inform public health actions, perform meta-analysis, better coordinate, and determine equitable distribution of monitoring sites.

In the face of the current pandemic, PHA4GE has identified a need for a fit-for-purpose, open-source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard.As such, we have developed a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification package based on harmonizable, publicly available community standards. The specification can be implemented via a collection template, as well as an array of protocols and tools to support both the harmonization and submission of sequence data and contextual information to public biorepositories.Well-structured, rich contextual data add value, promote reuse, and enable aggregation and integration of disparate datasets. Adoption of the proposed standard and practices will better enable interoperability between datasets and systems, improve the consistency and utility of generated data, and ultimately facilitate novel insights and discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. The package is now supported by the NCBI’s BioSample database.},

Wastewater surveillance data have been used to deploy clinical testing resources, investigate possible irregularities in traditional surveillance, refine health messaging, and forecast clinical resource needs. What are the implications for public health practice? NWSS provides community-level surveillance data that complement traditional surveillance and facilitate earlier, focused health department intervention and support in communities experiencing increasing trends in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. Community-level wastewater surveillance data can be leveraged for rapid assessment of emerging threats and preparedness for future pandemics.},

The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality.

Therefore, we inventorised and evaluated the potential of environmental health surveillance and research data sources in the European population to provide HBM-based indicators of internal human exposure and health impact of relevant chemicals. We established an up-dated inventory of European cross-sectional Human Biomonitoring (HBM) surveys and of birth cohorts, and compared chemicals and chemical groups addressed by HBM with indicators and health end points collected via European Core Health Indicators (ECHI), in birth registries, as well as in environmental and food data bases and health registries to see on how data collection could be aligned. Finally, we investigated study designs of HBM survey and health examination surveys for potential synergies. The inventory covers a total of 11 European cross-sectional national programmes and a large number of birth cohorts and includes information on study population, age groups, covered substances, sampled matrices, and frequency. The comparison of data collections shows that there are many overlaps between environmental chemicals with environmental and health reporting. HBM data could be linked with ECHI indicators for work-related risks, body mass index (BMI), and low birth weight, with perinatal disease, neurologic disorders, and some chronic diseases, or with data bases for e.g. indoor air, food, or consumer products. Existing initiatives to link data collections at European Environment Agency (EEA) and Joint Research Center (JRC) or at World Health Organization (WHO) are good options to further develop linkage of HBM with exposures sources and health end points. There is potential to use HBM based information in a number of public health policies, and this would help to align reporting to international commitments. Environmental health surveillance based on HBM and HBM-based indicators, is an excellent tool to inform public health policies about risks from environmental chemicals, and the EU health information system would benefit from additional HBM-based indicators for monitoring exposure burden from environmental chemicals. Considerable efforts are needed to align and establish routine data collections and to develop a surveillance system and indicators which may inform public health policies.},

The goal of providing these data is that stakeholders use them to develop projects that improve environmental health in their communities—that is, moving from “data to action.”           Objective:~           To encourage use of Wisconsin Tracking data, we developed a minigrants program and issued a funding opportunity to local health departments and tribes. The opportunity requested proposals for small projects using our data, with the goal of making public health improvements in those communities. Wisconsin Tracking evaluated the minigrants program after its completion.           Design/Setting:~           Eight local health departments in Wisconsin were awarded up to \$10 500 to develop and implement projects over a 9-month period.           Methods:~           Wisconsin Tracking created a funding opportunity announcement requiring utilization of our data to develop projects by local health departments in Wisconsin. We reviewed and scored applications, evaluating proposals on a range of criteria. During the 9-month project period, Wisconsin Tracking staff members provided a variety of technical assistance to grantees. An evaluation of the overall program followed.           Results:~           Funded communities used Wisconsin Tracking data to improve public health infrastructure, leverage partnerships, establish new initiatives, respond to emergencies, improve communication with stakeholders and residents, and make a variety of public health improvements in their communities.           Conclusions:~           Efforts to increase use of our data catalyzed development of small-scale environmental health projects. This minigrants program was successful at building relationships between local health departments and Wisconsin Tracking, increasing awareness of Wisconsin Tracking data and resources, and contributing to numerous documented public health improvements throughout Wisconsin.},

Design/Setting: The WI EPHT enhanced public portal is the next phase of Wisconsin's ongoing efforts in environmental public health tracking. As part of this process, this new mapping application includes mapping capacity that provides information on childhood lead testing and results at county and census tract levels in Wisconsin. Methods: The WI EPHT Program will update its public portal to have the capability to map data at a subcounty level (ie, census tract or zip code) for some data topics when such data are available. Results: This tool is available to local public health departments and other public health organizations throughout Wisconsin as a resource to identify communities most affected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new guidelines with regard to childhood lead poisoning.

  abstract = {In January 2001 the Pew Environmental Health Commission called for the creation of a coordinated public health system to prevent disease in the United States by tracking and combating environmental health threats. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated the Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program to integrate three distinct components of hazard monitoring and exposure and health effects surveillance into a cohesive tracking network. Uniform and acceptable data standards, easily understood case definitions, and improved communication between health and environmental agencies are just a few of the challenges that must be addressed for this network to be effective. The nascent EPHT program is attempting to respond to these challenges by drawing on a wide range of expertise from federal agencies, state health and environmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the program’s academic Centers of Excellence. In this mini-monograph, we present innovative strategies and methods that are being applied to the broad scope of important and complex environmental public health problems by developing EPHT programs. The data resulting from this program can be used to identify areas and populations most likely to be affected by environmental contamination and to provide important information on the health and environmental status of communities. EPHT will develop valuable data on possible associations between the environment and the risk of noninfectious health effects. These data can be used to reduce the burden of adverse health effects on the American public.},

  abstract = {Context:~           Public health surveillance includes dissemination of data and information to those who need it to take action to prevent or control disease. The concept of data to action is explicit in the mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program (Tracking Program). The CDC has built a National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) to integrate health and environmental data to drive public health action (PHA) to improve communities' health.           Objective:~           To assess the utility of the Tracking Program and Tracking Network in environmental public health practice and policy making.           Design:~           We analyzed information on how Tracking (all program components hereafter referred to generally as “Tracking”) has been used to drive PHAs within funded states and cities (grantees). Two case studies are presented to highlight Tracking's utility.           Setting:~           Analyses included all grantees funded between 2005 and 2013.           Participants:~           Twenty-seven states, 3 cities, and the District of Columbia ever received funding.           Main Outcome Measures:~           We categorized each PHA reported to determine how grantees became involved, their role, the problems addressed, and the overall action.           Results:~           Tracking grantees reported 178 PHAs from 2006 to 2013. The most common overall action was “provided information in response to concern” (n = 42), followed by “improved a public health program, intervention, or response plan” (n = 35). Tracking's role was most often either to enhance surveillance (24\%) or to analyze data (23\%). In 47\% of PHAs, the underlying problem was a concern about possible elevated rates of a health outcome, a potential exposure, or a potential association between a hazard and a health outcome. PHAs were started by a request for assistance (48\%), in response to an emergency (8\%), and though routine work by Tracking programs (43\%).           Conclusion:~           Our review shows that the data, expertise, technical infrastructure, and other resources of the Tracking Program and Tracking Network are driving state and local PHAs.},

With a renewed focus on data-driven decision-making, the CDC's Tracking Program emphasizes dissemination of actionable data to public health practitioners, policy makers, and communities. The CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network), a Web-based system with components at the national, state, and local levels, houses environmental public health data used to inform public health actions (PHAs) to improve community health. This article serves as a detailed landscape on the Tracking Program and Tracking Network and the Tracking Program's leading performance measure, “public health actions.” Tracking PHAs are qualitative statements addressing a local problem or situation, the role of the state or local Tracking Program, how the problem or situation was addressed, and the action taken. More than 400 PHAs have been reported by funded state and local health departments since the Tracking Program began collecting PHAs in 2005. Three case studies are provided to illustrate the use of the Tracking Program resources and data on the Tracking Network, and the diversity of actions taken. Through a collaborative network of experts, data, and tools, the Tracking Program and its Tracking Network are actively informing state and local PHAs. In a time of competing priorities and limited funding, PHAs can serve as a powerful tool to advance environmental public health practice.},

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced an initiative to develop a national environmental public health tracking (EPHT) network with “linkage” of existing environmental and chronic disease data as a central goal. On the basis of experience with long-established disease surveillance systems, in this article we suggest how a system capable of linking routinely collected disease and exposure data should be developed, but caution that formal linkage of data is not the only approach required for an effective EPHT program. The primary operational goal of EPHT has to be the “treatment” of the environment to prevent and/or reduce exposures and minimize population risk for developing chronic diseases. Chronic, multifactorial diseases do not lend themselves to data-driven evaluations of intervention strategies, time trends, exposure patterns, or identification of at-risk populations based only on routinely collected surveillance data. Thus, EPHT should be synonymous with a dynamic process requiring regular system updates to a) incorporate new technologies to improve population-level exposure and disease assessment, b) allow public dissemination of new data that become available, c) allow the policy community to address new and emerging exposures and disease “threads,” and d) evaluate the effectiveness of EPHT over some appropriate time interval. It will be necessary to weigh the benefits of surveillance against its costs, but the major challenge will be to maintain support for this important new system.},

  abstract = {Global environmental change has degraded ecosystems. Challenges such as climate change, resource depletion (with its huge implications for human health and wellbeing), and persistent social inequalities in health have been identified as global public health issues with implications for both communicable and noncommunicable diseases. This contributes to pressure on healthcare systems, as well as societal systems that affect health. A novel strategy to tackle these multiple, interacting and interdependent drivers of change is required to protect the population’s health. Public health professionals have found that building strong, enduring interdisciplinary partnerships across disciplines can address environment and health complexities, and that developing Environmental and Public Health Tracking (EPHT) systems has been an effective tool. EPHT aims to merge, integrate, analyse and interpret environmental hazards, exposure and health data. In this article, we explain that public health decision-makers can use EPHT insights to drive public health actions, reduce exposure and prevent the occurrence of disease more precisely in efficient and cost-effective ways. An international network exists for practitioners and researchers to monitor and use environmental health intelligence, and to support countries and local areas toward sustainable and healthy development. A global network of EPHT programs and professionals has the potential to advance global health by implementing and sharing experience, to magnify the impact of local efforts and to pursue data knowledge improvement strategies, aiming to recognise and support best practices. EPHT can help increase the understanding of environmental public health and global health, improve comparability of risks between different areas of the world including Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), enable transparency and trust among citizens, institutions and the private sector, and inform preventive decision making consistent with sustainable and healthy development. This shows how EPHT advances global health efforts by sharing recent global EPHT activities and resources with those working in this field. Experiences from the US, Europe, Asia and Australasia are outlined for operating successful tracking systems to advance global health.},

Surveillance for noninfectious diseases associated with exposure to agents in the environment like lead and pesticides has been a function of state health departments for more than 3 decades, but many state programs do not have adequate funding or staff for this function. Following the efforts to identify core public health epidemiology functions in chronic diseases, injury, and occupational health and safety, a workgroup of public health environmental epidemiologists operating within the organizational structure of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists has defined the essential core functions of noninfectious disease environmental epidemiology that should be present in every state health department and additional functions of a comprehensive program. These functions are described in terms of the “10 Essential Environmental Public Health Services” and their associated performance standards. Application of these consensus core and expanded functions should help state and large metropolitan health departments allocate resources and prioritize activities of their environmental epidemiologists, thus improving the delivery of environmental health services to the public.},

  abstract = {The need to look beyond the conventional target pollutants when assessing the hazards of chemicals to human health and to ecosystems is now generally recognised as a priority issue in all environmental policy areas at both the European level and national level in the various countries. It has also become clear that it is not possible for individual countries alone to develop the knowledge and methodologies needed for measuring and evaluating the effects and associated risks of a vast number of emerging pollutants. Further to these priority needs, the NORMAN project (http://www.norman-network.net) was funded in 2005 by the European Commission in order to promote the creation of a permanent network among reference laboratories and research centres, in collaboration with the parties involved (industry, standardisation bodies, NGOs, etc.), to ensure (i) a more rapid and wide-scope exchange of data and information on the occurrence and effects of emerging substances, (ii) better data quality and comparability via validation and harmonisation of common measurement methods (chemical and biological) and monitoring tools, (iii) more transparent information (need for information, not just data) and (iv) the establishment of an independent and competent forum for the technical/scientific debate on issues related to emerging substances. NORMAN plays a significant role as an interface organisation between science and policy, with the advantage of speaking with a “bigger voice” to the European Commission and other public institutions. The activities of the network range from a scientific watch and the feeding of data on emerging substances into NORMAN databases (information gateway on emerging pollutants) to the organisation of working groups and workshops (producing position papers on research priorities), the setting-up of interlaboratory studies and the organisation of measurement campaigns. This article presents the objectives and scope of the activities of the NORMAN network, together with a summary of its concrete achievements after six years of existence. Moreover, the article gives a special insight in the work done by the NORMAN Working Group on effect-directed analysis for the identification of hazardous pollutants.},

We may believe that our perspective is the right one and that any interaction with opposing views is a messy and unwelcome contradiction.So why should egalitarians engage with individualists, or hierachists with egalitarians? Using a range of examples and analogies, the author shows how the best outcomes depend upon an essential argumentative process, which encourages subversions that are constructive whilst discouraging those that are not. In this way each approach gets more of what it wants and less of what it doesn't want. Michael Thompson calls these best outcomes 'Clumsy Solutions'. The lively style of its presentation and its rigorous attention to detail makes this book suitable for a wide audience - from managers and academic theorists to those who are responsible for effective and enlightened action on challenging global issues.},

  abstract = {Accurate surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic can be weakened by under-reporting of cases, particularly due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, resulting in bias. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to infer infection prevalence, but uncertainty in sensitivity and considerable variability has meant that accurate measurement remains elusive. Here, we use data from 45 sewage sites in England, covering 31\% of the population, and estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence to within 1.1\% of estimates from representative prevalence surveys (with 95\% confidence). Using machine learning and phenomenological models, we show that differences between sampled sites, particularly the wastewater flow rate, influence prevalence estimation and require careful interpretation. We find that SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater appear 4–5 days earlier in comparison to clinical testing data but are coincident with prevalence surveys suggesting that wastewater surveillance can be a leading indicator for symptomatic viral infections. Surveillance for viruses in wastewater complements and strengthens clinical surveillance, with significant implications for public health.},

Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.},

A systems analysis approach to the study of the dynamic and control aspects of the system is discussed, with particular reference to the practical limitations of instrumentation and technology. In an attempt to blend the theory with the practice recent studies on the dynamic modelling and control of parts of the water quality system are reviewed. Special attention is paid to the practical application of techniques of system identification and parameter estimation. Finally, piecing together several individual results, it is possible to give a good indication of the manner in which control studies should be directed in the near future.},

Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.},

  abstract = {Cities are increasingly burdened by aging water infrastructure. Deferred maintenance and upgrades are compounded by emerging concerns over contaminants, extreme weather events, demographic shifts, equity, and affordability of water services. These and other evolving twenty-first century conditions prompt changes to urban water infrastructure and related systems that have wide ranging outcomes. This work demonstrates two complementary techniques for analyzing these complex systems, through the example case of Chicago. Chicago has some of the oldest urban water infrastructure in the US and supplies drinking water to more than 5 million people. Recent efforts to improve the physical and financial components of Chicago's water system have run into a gamut of social and environmental issues. Here, a socio-environmental systems (SES) context for Chicago's water infrastructure is structured using a rigorous systems thinking method and visual grammar to map the SES in terms of distinctions, systems, relationships and perspectives (DSRP). DSRP maps structure information about how water flows through city and how money flows through the public utilities responsible for drinking water delivery, wastewater treatment and stormwater management. Flows are evaluated, using open data and methods, over a 23-year period (1995–2017). Overall declines in water use and wastewater production are accompanied by an increase in the costs of water services, costs that support not only water infrastructure operations, maintenance and capital improvements, but also other municipal functions. Trends in the integrated data are interpreted through iterative refinement of DSRP maps to include additional components and to consider the SES from different points of view. Findings suggest that systems thinking is important for designing urban water system upgrades that are responsive to diverse socio-environmental concerns. As changes are made, transparent, reproducible methods for tracking outcomes can support analysis of differential impacts on users. The methods applied here at the city scale may be used to better understand localized, complex issues surrounding water infrastructure upgrades in Chicago and other cities.},

Specifically, Systems Thinking is the opposite of linear thinking; holistic (integrative) versus analytic (dissective) thinking; recognizing that repeated events or patterns derive from systemic structures which, in turn, derive from mental models; recognizing that behaviors derive from structure; a focus on relationships vs components; and an appreciation of self-organization and emergence. Specific Systems Thinking tools include systemigrams, system archetypes, main chain infrastructures, causal loops with feedback and delays; stock and flow diagrams; behavior-over-time graphs, computer modeling of system dynamics, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and systemic root cause analysis.},

Meadows' newly released manuscript, "Thinking in Systems," is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute's Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world--war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation--are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, "Thinking in Systems" helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

Both in theory and in practice, it has been widely acknowledged that the challenges of the twenty-first century require solutions that address problems in a more integrated way. Although the demand for integration is obvious, implementation has proved challenging because of the complexity and uncertainty involved. In addition, the urban water literature contains a wide diversity of approaches to integration, each contribution having its own understanding of the term, as well as how to deal with the complexity that comes with it. In this article, we take a first step in supporting both decision-making and decision-makers in urban water systems integration. First, we work towards a more comprehensive perspective on integration in urban water management; one that uses and structures the variety of existing approaches. In so doing, we introduce a typology of urban water systems integration that distinguishes between geographical, physical, informational, and project-based forms. Second, we explore the implications that such integrated solutions bring for decision-makers. They will be faced with additional uncertainty arising (1) at the interfaces of previously unconnected systems and (2) from the social and institutional changes that systems integration requires. Finally, we draft three decision-making challenges that come with integration and provide some possibilities for dealing with them.},

Although many empirical sediment transport equations are known in the literature, there is only limited knowledge concerning particle velocity. Sediment particle and sphere velocity measurements were carried out in two pipe channels and these results led to the development of a semi-theoretical equation for sediment transport at the limit of deposition in sewers. Even in the transport process without deposition, sediment movement is slower than water velocity and depends on the angle of repose of sediment with a diameter d on the roughness k of the pipe channel. Instead of classical dimensionless bed shear stress ψ, a modified dimensionless bed shear stress ψ (d/k)2/3 was suggested, based on the angle of repose and this parameter was proved to be significant for quantifying the transport capacity. The main purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of careful observation of experiments. Not only number of tests, but physical understanding are essential for better empirical equations.},

Next, its performance is improved by integrating the particle settling velocity distribution and adding a description of the resuspension due to pumping for emptying the tank. Finally, the potential of the improved model is demonstrated by comparing the results for one more rain event.},

This paper presents the second iteration of the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Open Data Model (PHES-ODM), an open-source dictionary and set of data tools to enhance the interoperability of environmental surveillance data and enable the storage of contextual (meta)data. The data model describes how to store environmental surveillance program data, metadata about measurements taken on various specimens (water, air, surfaces, sites, populations) and data about measurement protocols. The model provides software tools that support the collection and use of PHES-ODM formatted data, including performing PCR calculations and data validation, recording data into input templates, generating wide tables for analysis, and producing SQL database definitions. Fully open-source and already adopted by institutions in Canada, the European Union, and other countries, the PHES-ODM provides a path forward for creating robust, interoperable, open datasets for environmental public health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and beyond.},

However, there is not yet a standard protocol to guide its implementation. In this paper, we proposed a comprehensive technical and theoretical framework of relative quantification via qPCR for determining the virus abundance in wastewater and estimating the infection ratio in corresponding communities, which is expected to achieve horizontal and vertical comparability of the data using a human-specific biomarker as the internal reference. Critical factors affecting the virus detectability and the estimation of infection ratio include virus concentration methods, lag-period, per capita virus shedding amount, sewage generation rate, temperature-related decay kinetics of virus/biomarker in wastewater, and hydraulic retention time (HRT), etc. Theoretical simulation shows that the main factors affecting the detectability of virus in sewage are per capita virus shedding amount and sewage generation rate. While the decay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage is a relatively slow process, which may have limited impact on its detection. Under the ideal condition of high per capita virus shedding amount and low sewage generation rate, it is expected to detect a single infected person within 400,000 people.},

  abstract = {As water-sector professionals re-discover the value in the 'waste' conveyed in 'waste'water, this Viewpoint argues that the theory of plural rationality (also known as Cultural Theory) may accelerate the switch from waste management to resource recovery. Accordingly, it extends the framing of plural rationality, from its traditional applications in matters of governance and social and economic analysis, to the beginnings of a set of plural schools of engineering thought. This sounds controversial. Indeed, we hope it is. For all too often ways to resolve water issues end up in the impasse of two deeply entrenched positions: the 'technocratic reductionism' of the 'quick engineering fix' to problem solving; and the 'participatory holism' of the 'local, socially sensitive, integrationist' approach. Plural rationality sees this is an impoverished duopoly. Our very strong preference is to find ways of promoting the creative interplay among plural (more than two), mutually opposed, contending ways of framing a problem and resolving it. This, we argue, should not only expand the portfolio of possible alternatives for technology-policy interventions, but also lead to the chosen alternative being preferable — in social, economic, and environmental terms — to what might otherwise have happened. Such solutions are called 'clumsy' in plural rationality theory. We use a synopsis of a case history of restoring water quality in the River Rhine in Europe, within a wider account of the sweep of resource recovery spanning two centuries (late 18th Century through early 21st Century), to illustrate how clumsiness works. This, however, does not extend to our elaborating our proposed set of plural schools of engineering thought beyond just its very beginnings. Our Viewpoint allows us merely to start framing the challenge of developing, and eventually applying, such a notion.},

  abstract = {Citalopram (CIT) is one of the most consumed antidepressants and frequently detected in aquatic environments worldwide. Conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove this neuronal active pharmaceutical efficiently. Past studies showed that moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) can degrade CIT but the exact transformation pathways and toxicity reduction remained unclear. In this study, the effects of substrate stimulation on CIT transformation in an MBBR were systematically investigated. The results showed that a co-metabolic stimulation by acetate increased the transformation rate by 54 \% and 24 \% at high (300 μg/L) and environmental concentration (1.8 μg/L) of CIT, respectively. Conversely, the complex substrates in raw wastewater reduced the reaction rates by 44 \%, suggesting a competitive inhibition on the enzymatic sites. The substrate stimulation changed the enantiomeric fraction (EF) of CIT from racemic (EF=0.5) to 0.60 at the high CIT concentrations, while those at lower concentrations resulted in an EF of 0.33, indicating that probably different enantioselective enzymes degraded CIT at high concentrations than at low concentrations, i.e., the presence of 300 µg/L CIT was possibly sufficient to induce the synthesis of different enantioselective enzymes, than those originally present. Through non-target and target analysis, in total 19 transformation products (TPs) including 7 TPs that were hitherto not mentioned in the literature were identified. Among these were quaternary amines, alkenes and conjugate TPs. The major transformation pathways were a) nitrile hydrolysis (up to 43 \%), b) amide hydrolysis, and c) N-oxidation. Dosing acetate up-regulated significantly the amide hydrolysis, N-oxidation and conjugation pathways but inhibited the N-demethylation and α-carbon hydroxylation pathways. The in-silico toxicity assessment of CIT and its TPs suggested the overall eco-toxic potential of TPs was reduced by MBBR. Furthermore, the degradation under carbon-limited (famine) conditions favored the formation of the more toxic carboxamide, N-desmethyl and alkene TPs, while carbon-rich conditions, promoted the production of the less toxic carboxylic acid, N-oxide and ester TPs. Therefore, this study demonstrated that a) the co-metabolic stimulation of CIT metabolization by dosing a simple carbon source or b) inhibition of CIT metabolization by complex substrates; c) substrate stimulation made a difference on CIT transformation rates, enantiomeric profiles, pathways and toxic potentials. Overall, a simple-carbon co-metabolic stimulated MBBR was an efficient up-regulation strategy to minimize hazardous CIT and CIT-TPs as much as possible.},

Analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry identified four metabolites. Subsequently, a targeted liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for their analysis in wastewater samples collected from a music festival in Australia. The successful application of this workflow opens the door for future work to better understand the metabolism of chemicals and their detection and application for wastewater-based epidemiology.},

Predictive modelling can provide this information, though challenges concerning the optimal size of training data, model transferability, and communication of uncertainty still need attention. Further, urban estuaries undergo distinctive hydrological variations requiring tailored modelling approaches. This study assessed the use of Bayesian Networks (BNs) for the prediction of enterococci exceedances and extrapolation of health risks at planned bathing sites in an urban estuary in Sydney, Australia. The transferability of network structures between sites was assessed. Models were validated using a novel application of the k-fold walk-forward validation procedure and further tested using independent compliance and event-based sampling datasets. Learning curves indicated the model's sensitivity reached a minimum performance threshold of 0.8 once training data included ≥ 400 observations. It was demonstrated that Semi-Naïve BN structures can be transferred while maintaining stable predictive performance. In all sites, salinity and solar exposure had the greatest influence on Posterior Probability Distributions (PPDs), when combined with antecedent rainfall. The BNs provided a novel and transparent framework to quantify and visualise enterococci, stormwater impact, health risks, and associated uncertainty under varying environmental conditions. This study has advanced the application of BNs in predicting recreational water quality and providing decision support in urban estuarine settings, proposed for bathing, where uncertainty is high.},

  abstract = {Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genome sequencing are important methods for wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) is a highly sensitive method for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples to track the trends of viral activity levels but cannot identify new variants. It also takes time to develop new PCR-based assays targeting variants of interest. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to monitor known and new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but it is generally not quantitative. Several short-read sequencing techniques can be expensive and might experience delayed turnaround times when outsourced due to inadequate in-house resources. Recently, a portable nanopore sequencing system offers an affordable and real-time method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater. This technology has the potential to enable swift response to disease outbreaks without relying on clinical sequencing results. In addressing concerns related to rapid turnaround time and accurate variant analysis, both RT-ddPCR and nanopore sequencing methods were employed to monitor the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater. This surveillance was conducted at 23 sewer maintenance hole sites and five wastewater treatment plants in Michigan from 2020 to 2022. In 2020, the wastewater samples were dominated by the parental variants (20A, 20C and 20 G), followed by 20I (Alpha, B.1.1.7) in early 2021 and the Delta variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. For the year 2022, Omicron variants dominated. Nanopore sequencing has the potential to validate suspected variant cases that were initially undetermined by RT-ddPCR assays. The concordance rate between nanopore sequencing and RT-ddPCR assays in identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants to the clade-level was 76.9\%. Notably, instances of disagreement between the two methods were most prominent in the identification of the parental and Omicron variants. We also showed that sequencing wastewater samples with SARS-CoV-2 N gene concentrations of {$>$}104 GC/100 ml as measured by RT-ddPCR improve genome recovery and coverage depth using MinION device. RT-ddPCR was better at detecting key spike protein mutations A67V, del69–70, K417N, L452R, N501Y, N679K, and R408S (p-value {$<$}0.05) as compared to nanopore sequencing. It is suggested that RT-ddPCR and nanopore sequencing should be coordinated in wastewater surveillance where RT-ddPCR can be used as a preliminary quantification method and nanopore sequencing as the confirmatory method for the detection of variants or identification of new variants. The RT-ddPCR and nanopore sequencing methods reported here can be adopted as a reliable in-house analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater for rapid community level surveillance and public health response.},

The European Health Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), along with international partners, are leading efforts to establish a global consortium for WES. The aim is to improve coordination and adaptability to technological advances. The EU Wastewater Observatory for Public Health has been launched, demonstrating a commitment to integrating WES into policy. This is endorsed by the EU4Health 2024 Work Programme, which mandates wastewater testing to boost preparedness against cross-border health threats. This initiative aligns with the EU's objective of strengthening health system responsiveness and coordination among Member States in the face of such threats. Wastewater-based surveillance is set to become a fundamental part of public health services in the EU and beyond.

In the method, we improve data integrity and data volume through data preprocessing. And the network processes input data forward and backward and considers the dependencies at multiple time scales. Besides, we use the Box–Behnken experimental design method to adjust hyper-parameters in the process of modeling. In this study, we apply this method to the water quality prediction research of Beilun Estuary, and the performance of our proposed model is evaluated and compared with other models.

  abstract = {Water quality monitoring is an important component of water resources management. In order to predict two water quality variables, namely dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; µg/L) in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece, two standalone deep learning (DL) models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, along with their hybrid, the CNN–LSTM model, were developed. The main novelty of this study was to build a coupled CNN–LSTM model to predict water quality variables. Two traditional machine learning models, support-vector regression (SVR) and decision tree (DT), were also developed to compare with the DL models. Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, specifically pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (°C), electrical conductivity (EC; µS/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t\,−\,1) and two (t\,−\,2) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively. Each model’s performance in both training and testing phases was assessed using statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents (RRMSE, RMAE; \%), percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (\$\$E\_\{NS\}\$\$), Willmott’s Index, and graphical plots (Taylor diagram, box plot and spider diagram). Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN–LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a. By integrating the LSTM and CNN models, the hybrid model successfully captured both the low and high levels of the water quality variables, particularly for the DO concentrations.},

  abstract = {Water quality prediction is an effective method for managing and protecting water resources by providing an early warning against water quality deterioration. In general, the existing water quality prediction methods are based on a single shallow model which fails to capture the long-term dependence in historical time series and is more likely to cause a high rate of false alarms and false negatives in practical water monitoring application. To resolve these problems, a new model combining recurrent neural network (RNN) with improved Dempster/Shafer (D-S) evidence theory (RNNs-DS) is proposed in this paper. Among them, the RNNs which can handle the long-term dependence in historical time series effectively are used to realize the preliminary prediction of water quality. And the improved D-S evidence theory is used to synthesize the prediction results of RNNs. In addition, an improved strategy based on correlation analysis method is presented for evidence theory to obtain the number of evidence, which reduces uncertainty in evidence selection effectively. Besides, a new basic probability assignment function which based on modified softmax function is proposed. The new function can effectively solve the problems of weight allocation failure in the traditional function. Then, data about permanganate index, pH, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen from Jiuxishuichang monitoring station near Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China is used to verify the proposed model. Compared with support vector regression (SVR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and three RNN models, the new model shows higher accuracy and better stability as indicated by four indices. Finally, the engineering application of the RNNs-DS algorithm has been realized on the self-developed water environmental monitoring and forecasting system, which can provide effective support for early risk assessment and prevention in water environment.},

Although informed public health measures can be better implemented for a small population, WBE for neighborhood-scale sewersheds is less studied and not fully understood. This study applied WBE to seven neighborhood-scale sewersheds (average population of 1471) from January to November 2021. Community testing data showed an average of 0.004 \% incidence rate in these sewersheds (97 \% of monitoring periods reported two or fewer daily infections). In 92 \% of sewage samples, SARS-CoV-2 N gene fragments were below the limit of quantification. We statistically determined 10–2.6 as the threshold of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene concentration normalized to pepper mild mottle virus (N/PMMOV) to alert high COVID-19 incidence rate in the studied sewershed. This threshold of N/PMMOV identified neighborhood-scale outbreaks (COVID-19 incidence rate higher than 0.2 \%) with 82 \% sensitivity and 51 \% specificity. Importantly, neighborhood-scale WBE can discern local outbreaks that would not otherwise be identified by city-scale WBE. Our findings suggest that neighborhood-scale WBE is an effective community-wide disease surveillance tool when COVID-19 incidence is maintained at a low level.},

This activity is colloquially known as sewer monitoring and is referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology in academic settings. Although global ethical principles have been described, sewer monitoring is unregulated for health privacy protection when used for public health surveillance in the United States. This study used Qualtrics XM, a national research panel provider, to recruit participants to answer an online survey. Respondents (N = 3,083) answered questions about their knowledge, perceptions of what is to be monitored, where monitoring should occur, and privacy concerns related to sewer monitoring as a public health surveillance tool. Furthermore, a privacy attitude questionnaire was used to assess the general privacy boundaries of respondents. Participants were more likely to support monitoring for diseases (92\%), environmental toxins (92\%), and terrorist threats (88\%; e.g., anthrax). Two-third of the respondents endorsed no prohibition on location sampling scale (e.g., monitoring single residence to entire community was acceptable); the most common location category respondents wanted to prohibit sampling was at personal residences. Sewer monitoring is an emerging technology, and our study sheds light on perceptions that could benefit from educational programs in areas where public acceptance is comparatively lower. Respondents clearly communicated guard rails for sewer monitoring, and public opinion should inform future policy, application, and regulation measures.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

This long-awaited book offers the4first integrative presentation of the principles of decision analysis in a behavioural context. The authors break new ground on a variety of technical topics (sensitivity analysis, the value-utility distinction, multistage inference, attitudes toward risk), and attempt to make intuitive sense out of what have been treated in the literature as endemic biases and other errors of human judgement. Those interested in artificial intelligence will find it the easiest presentation of hierarchical Bayesian inference available.},

  abstract = {We develop an efficient and effective implementation of the Newton—Raphson (NR) algorithm for estimating the parameters in mixed-effects models for repeated-measures data. We formulate the derivatives for both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation and propose improvements to the algorithm discussed by Jennrich and Schlüchter (1986) to speed convergence and ensure a positive-definite covariance matrix for the random effects at each iteration. We use matrix decompositions to develop efficient and computationally stable implementations of both the NR algorithm and an EM algorithm (Laird and Ware 1982) for this model. We compare the two methods (EM vs. NR) in terms of computational order and performance on two sample data sets and conclude that in most situations a well-implemented NR algorithm is preferable to the EM algorithm or EM algorithm with Aitken's acceleration. The term repeated measures refers to experimental designs where there are several individuals and several measurements taken on each individual. In the mixed-effects model each individual's vector of responses is modeled as a parametric function, where some of the parameters or “effects” are random variables with a multivariate normal distribution. This model has been successful because it can handle unbalanced data (different designs for different individuals), missing data (observations on all individuals are taken at the same design points, but some individuals have missing data), and jointly dependent random effects. The price for this flexibility is that the parameter estimates may be difficult to compute. We propose some new methods for implementing the EM and NR algorithms and draw conclusions about their performance. We also discuss extensions of the mixed-effects model to incoporate nonindependent conditional error structure and nested-type designs.},

Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That’s why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day.},

Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle.},

To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

  abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL.

Such models are highly complex, dynamic and non-linear, requiring long computation times, especially in the scope of MC simulation, due to the large number of simulations usually required. However, no stopping rule to decide on the number of simulations required to achieve a given confidence in the MC simulation results has been adopted so far in the field. In this work, a pragmatic method is proposed to minimize the computation time by using a combination of several criteria. It makes no use of prior knowledge about the model, is very simple, intuitive and can be automated: all convenient features in engineering applications. A case study is used to show an application of the method, and the results indicate that the required number of simulations strongly depends on the model output(s) selected, and on the type and desired accuracy of the analysis conducted. Hence, no prior indication is available regarding the necessary number of MC simulations, but the proposed method is capable of dealing with these variations and stopping the calculations after convergence is reached.},

  abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different thinned networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.}

Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems. In this paper, optimizing the hyper-parameters of common machine learning models is studied. We introduce several state-of-the-art optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization.

Additionally, we propose successive mini-batch gradient descent and multi-granularity discretization to further improve efficiency and effectiveness, while ensuring simplicity so that no machine learning expertise or tedious hyper-parameter tuning is required. Furthermore, the algorithms are designed to reduce the computational, transmitting, and storage costs involved in distributed computing. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world business datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AutoCross.

Existing approaches to automate this process rely on either transformed feature space exploration through evaluation-guided search, or explicit expansion of datasets with all transformed features followed by feature selection. Such approaches incur high computational costs in runtime and/or memory. We present a novel technique, called Learning Feature Engineering (LFE), for automating feature engineering in classification tasks. LFE is based on learning the effectiveness of applying a transformation (e.g., arithmetic or aggregate operators) on numerical features, from past feature engineering experiences. Given a new dataset, LFE recommends a set of useful transformations to be applied on features without relying on model evaluation or explicit feature expansion and selection. Using a collection of datasets, we train a set of neural networks, which aim at predicting the transformation that impacts classification performance positively. Our empirical results show that LFE outperforms other feature engineering approaches for an overwhelming majority (89\%) of the datasets from various sources while incurring a substantially lower computational cost.},

Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identification application.},

Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice.

  abstract = {Deep neural network acoustic models produce substantial gains in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems. Emerging work with rectified linear (ReL) hidden units demonstrates additional gains in final system performance relative to more commonly used sigmoidal nonlinearities. In this work, we explore the use of deep rectifier networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour Switchboard conversational speech recognition task. Using simple training procedures without pretraining, networks with rectifier nonlinearities produce 2\% absolute reductions in word error rates over their sigmoidal counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations to quantify differences in how ReL units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal units. Finally, we evaluate a variant of the ReL unit with a gradient more amenable to optimization in an attempt to further improve deep rectifier networks.},

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

  abstract = {The operation of modern wastewater treatment facilities is a balancing act in which a multitude of variables are controlled to achieve a wide range of objectives, many of which are conflicting. This is especially true within secondary activated sludge systems, where significant research and industry effort has been devoted to advance control optimization strategies, both domain-driven and data-driven. Among data-driven control strategies, reinforcement learning (RL) stands out for its ability to achieve better than human performance in complex environments. While RL has been applied to activated sludge process optimization in existing literature, these applications are typically limited in scope, and never for the control of more than three actions. Expanding the scope of RL control has the potential to increase the optimization potential while concurrently reducing the number of control systems that must be tuned and maintained by operations staff. This study examined several facets of the implementation of multi-action, multi-objective RL agents, namely how many actions a single agent could successfully control and what extent of environment data was necessary to train such agents. This study observed improved control optimization with increasing action scope, though control of waste activated sludge remains a challenge. Furthermore, agents were able to maintain a high level of performance under decreased observation scope, up to a point. When compared to baseline control of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1), an RL agent controlling seven individual actions improved the average BSM1 performance metric by 8.3 \%, equivalent to an annual cost savings of \$40,200 after accounting for the cost of additional sensors.},

The information gained was used to help monitor, communicate, and manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid and significant innovations in the field of WBS were realised in parallel in multiple jurisdictions globally. Global collaboration resulted in step-change improvements in multiple aspects of WBS simultaneously, including: health sector leadership; integration with public health surveillance; social and ethical guidance; high-level tactical wastewater catchment sampling strategies; wastewater sampling techniques; transport and storage of samples; laboratory analysis; normalisation and standardisation; data analysis and interpretation; and communication of results. Innovations in WBS relating to COVID-19 continue to take place, and the benefits of those improvements are now being applied to other targets, such as other pathogens and genes. There are many journal articles and other publications describing these innovations. However, valuable lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic for WBS have not been systematically documented into a practical and readily digestible format. The purpose of this ‘Cookbook’ is to provide practical and proven ‘recipes’ for WBS for SARS-CoV-2 for two reasons: firstly to help those considering new or extended WBS programmes targeting SARS-CoV-2; and secondly to provide a valuable record of what has been learned from the 2020- 2023 period to help inform WBS programmes to respond to future pandemics and for surveillance of other targets. The Cookbook is structured into eight parts: 1. Introduction; 2. High-level Overview; 3. Health Sector Perspectives; 4. Methods and Methodologies - From data to action; 5. Methods and Methodologies - Measurement and testing; 6. Methods and Methodologies - Sampling; 6. Methods and Methodologies - Transportation protocols; 8. Conclusions. Multiple authors have contributed to each part, primarily from the European Union, as well as others from the global community of practice. The Cookbook has been drafted by a global team of authors, with one or more lead authors identified for each chapter and working with their co-authors. The chapters were then subjected to extensive peer review from the external review group. These authors and reviewers are acknowledged in the Cookbook.},

  abstract = {Background Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance has been proposed as an early warning system (EWS) for community SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, there is limited data from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to assess the ability of WBE surveillance to detect SARS-CoV-2 in formal and informal environments in Indonesia using different methods of sample collection, to compare WBE data with patterns of clinical cases of COVID-19 within the relevant communities, and to assess the WBE potential to be used as an EWS for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within a community. Materials and methods We conducted WBE surveillance in three districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia, over eleven months (27 July 2021 to 7 January 2022 [Delta wave]; 18 January to 3 June 2022 [Omicron wave]). Water samples using grab, and/or passive sampling methods and soil samples were collected either weekly or fortnightly. RNA was extracted from membrane filters from processed water samples and directly from soil. Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N and ORF1ab genes. Results A total of 1,582 samples were collected. Detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater reflected the incidence of community cases, with rates of 85\% at the peak to 2\% at the end of the Delta wave and from 94\% to 11\% during the Omicron wave. A 2-week lag time was observed between the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and increasing cases in the corresponding community. Conclusion WBE surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia was effective in monitoring patterns of cases of COVID-19 and served as an early warning system, predicting the increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases in the community.},

For unsewered areas using septic tank systems (STSs) or holding tanks, how to conduct WWS remains unexplored. Here, two large STSs serving Zuma Beach (Malibu, CA) were studied. Supernatant and sludge SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from the directly-sampled STSs parameterized a dynamic solid–liquid separation, mass balance-based model for estimating the infection rate of users. Pumped septage before hauling and upon WWTP disposal was also sampled and assessed. Most (96\%) STS sludge samples contained SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 genes, with concentrations exceeding the supernatant and increasing with depth while correlating with total suspended solids (TSS). The trucked septage contained N1 and N2 genes which decayed (coefficients: 0.09–0.29 h−1) but remained detectable. Over approximately 5 months starting in December 2020, modeled COVID-19 prevalence estimations among users ranged from 8 to 18\%, mirroring a larger metropolitan area for the first 2 months. The approaches herein can inform public health intervention and augment conventional WWS in that: (1) user infection rates for communal holding tanks are estimable and (2) pumped and hauled septage can be assayed to infer where disease is spreading in unsewered areas.},

While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has not previously been identified in wastewater, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the feces of at least one patient, raising concerns about the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The fate and inactivation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are unknown, with current inactivation estimates based on surrogate models. In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and RNA signal was determined in water and wastewater. The times for 90\% reduction (T90) of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and tap water at room temperature were 1.5 and 1.7 days, respectively. In high-starting titer (105 TCID50 mL–1) experiments, infectious virus persisted for the entire 7-day sampling time course. In wastewater at 50 and 70 °C, the observed T90 values for infectious SARS-CoV-2 were decreased to 15 and 2 min, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found to be significantly more persistent than infectious SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the environmental detection of RNA alone does not substantiate risk of infection.},

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNAhas rapidly developed worldwide. In low-prevalence settings, sampling in sewage networks is proposed to monitor community transmission. Passive samplers are cost-effective and suitable for catchments where autosamplers cannot be operated. This resulted in their pioneering applications in some countries, even though their sampling kinetics for viruses remains unclear. We conducted in situ calibration of passive sampling materials (membranes, swabs, gauzes, and tampons) for the uptake of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), enterovirus, and human adenovirus 40/41. Passive samplers were deployed in wastewater influent and retrieved sequentially over 48 h. Membranes performed continuous sampling over 48 h with estimated linear sampling rates of 1 mL h–1 for PMMoV, 0.3 mL h–1 for enterovirus, and 33.1 mL h–1 for adenovirus. Tampons and swabs showed a rapid initial uptake of viruses and reached equilibrium after 8 h, while gauze uptake rates were potentially confounded by either inhibitors or viral losses during extended exposure. Additionally, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 at 17 sewer manholes showed that the detection ratio of membranes (14 of 17) was higher than that of tampons (8 of 17). This study demonstrated the ability of passive samplers to retain viral fragments, making them a practical tool for wastewater surveillance for the detection of disease outbreaks in communities.},

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance for pathogens using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an effective and resource-efficient tool for gathering community-level public health information, including the incidence of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater can potentially provide an early warning signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world's environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA characterization in wastewater is increasing rapidly. However, there are no standardized protocols or harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a technical review of factors that can cause false-positive and false-negative errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, culminating in recommended strategies that can be implemented to identify and mitigate some of these errors. Recommendations include stringent QA/QC measures, representative sampling approaches, effective virus concentration and efficient RNA extraction, PCR inhibition assessment, inclusion of sample processing controls, and considerations for RT-PCR assay selection and data interpretation. Clear data interpretation guidelines (e.g., determination of positive and negative samples) are critical, particularly when the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is low. Corrective and confirmatory actions must be in place for inconclusive results or results diverging from current trends (e.g., initial onset or reemergence of COVID-19 in a community). It is also prudent to perform interlaboratory comparisons to ensure results' reliability and interpretability for prospective and retrospective analyses. The strategies that are recommended in this review aim to improve SARS-CoV-2 characterization and detection for wastewater surveillance applications. A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the efficacy of wastewater surveillance continues to be demonstrated during this global crisis. In the future, wastewater should also play an important role in the surveillance of a range of other communicable diseases.},

However, accounting for environmental and sample-processing losses may be necessary for wastewater measurements to readily inform our understanding of infection prevalence. Here, we present measurements of the SARS-CoV-2~N1 and N2 gene targets from weekly wastewater samples at three sites in Hamilton County, Ohio, during an increase and subsequent decline of COVID-19 infections. The concentration of N1 or N2 RNA in wastewater, measured over the course of six months, ranged from below the detection limit to over 104 gene copies/l, and correlated with case data at two wastewater treatment plants, but not at a sub-sewershed-level sampling site. We also evaluated the utility of a broader range of variables than has been reported consistently in previous work, in improving correlations of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with case data. These include a spiked matrix recovery control (OC43), flow-normalization, and assessment of fecal loading using endogenous fecal markers (HF183, PMMoV, crAssphage). We found that adjusting for recovery, flow, and fecal indicators increased these correlations for samples from a larger sewershed (serving \textasciitilde 488,000 people) with greater industrial and stormwater inputs, but raw N1/N2 concentrations corresponded better with case data at a smaller, residential-oriented sewershed. Our results indicate that the optimal adjustment factors for correlating wastewater and clinical case data moving forward may not be generalizable to all sewersheds.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 transmission models have conferred great value in informing public health understanding, planning, and response. However, the pandemic also demonstrated the infeasibility of basing public health decision-making on transmission models with pre-set assumptions. No matter how favourably evidenced when built, a model with fixed assumptions is challenged by numerous factors that are difficult to predict. Ongoing planning associated with rolling back and re-instituting measures, initiating surge planning, and issuing public health advisories can benefit from approaches that allow state estimates for transmission models to be continuously updated in light of unfolding time series. A model being continuously regrounded by empirical data in this way can provide a consistent, integrated depiction of the evolving underlying epidemiology and acute care demand, offer the ability to project forward such a depiction in a fashion suitable for triggering the deployment of acute care surge capacity or public health measures, and support quantitative evaluation of tradeoffs associated with prospective interventions in light of the latest estimates of the underlying epidemiology. We describe here the design, implementation, and multi-year daily use for public health and clinical support decision-making of a particle-filtered COVID-19 compartmental model, which served Canadian federal and provincial governments via regular reporting starting in June 2020. The use of the Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of particle filtering allows the model to be regrounded daily and adapt to new trends within daily incoming data—including test volumes and positivity rates, endogenous and travel-related cases, hospital census and admissions flows, daily counts of dose-specific vaccinations administered, measured concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and mortality. Important model outputs include estimates (via sampling) of the count of undiagnosed infectives, the count of individuals at different stages of the natural history of frankly and pauci-symptomatic infection, the current force of infection, effective reproductive number, and current and cumulative infection prevalence. Following a brief description of the model design, we describe how the machine learning algorithm of particle filtering is used to continually reground estimates of the dynamic model state, support a probabilistic model projection of epidemiology and health system capacity utilization and service demand, and probabilistically evaluate tradeoffs between potential intervention scenarios. We further note aspects of model use in practice as an effective reporting tool in a manner that is parameterized by jurisdiction, including the support of a scripting pipeline that permits a fully automated reporting pipeline other than security-restricted new data retrieval, including automated model deployment, data validity checks, and automatic post-scenario scripting and reporting. As demonstrated by this multi-year deployment of the Bayesian machine learning algorithm of particle filtering to provide industrial-strength reporting to inform public health decision-making across Canada, such methods offer strong support for evidence-based public health decision-making informed by ever-current articulated transmission models whose probabilistic state and parameter estimates are continually regrounded by diverse data streams.},

However, currently available methods are laborious, costly, and time-consuming due to the low concentration of viruses and the presence of matrix chemicals in wastewater that may interfere with molecular analyses. In the present study, we designed a highly sensitive “Quick Poop (wastewater with fecal waste) Sensor” (termed, QPsor) using a joint approach of Nanotrap microbiome particles and RICCA (RNA Isothermal Co-Assisted and Coupled Amplification). Using QPsor, the WBE study showed a strong correlation with standard PEG concentrations and the qPCR technique. Using a closed format for a paper-based lateral flow assay, we were able to demonstrate the potential of our assay as a real-time, point-of-care test by detecting the heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater at concentrations of 100 copies/mL and within one hour. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we analyzed the presence of viral RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and PMMoV in raw wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants on-site and within 60 min. The results show that the QPsor method can be an effective tool for disease outbreak detection by combining an AI-enabled case detection model with real-time on-site viral RNA extraction and amplification, especially in the absence of intensive clinical laboratory facilities. The lab-free, lab-quality test capabilities of QPsor for viral prevalence and transmission in the community can contribute to the efficient management of pandemic situations.},

Viruses and bacteria were commonly investigated, while research on protozoa, helminths, and fungi was infrequent. Articles prior to 2019 were dominated by research on pathogens transmitted through fecal–oral or waterborne pathways, whereas more recent articles have explored the detection of pathogens transmitted through other pathways such as respiratory and vector-borne. There was variation in sampling, samples, and sample processing across studies. The current evidence suggests that wastewater monitoring could be applied to a range of pathogens as a public health tool to detect an emerging pathogen and understand the burden and spread of disease to inform decision-making. Further development and refinement of the methods to identify and interpret wastewater signals for different prioritized pathogens are needed to develop standards on when, why, and how to monitor effectively.},

RT-qPCR allelic discrimination assays were sufficiently sensitive and specific for detection and relative quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater to allow for rapid population-level screening and surveillance. We tested 261 samples collected from 5 Canadian cities (Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax) and 6 communities in the Northwest Territories from February 16th to March 28th, 2021. VoC were not detected in the Territorial communities, suggesting the absence of VoC SARS-CoV-2 cases in those communities. Percentage of variant remained low throughout the study period in the majority of the sites tested, however the Toronto sites showed a marked increase from \textasciitilde 25\% to \textasciitilde 75\% over the study period. The results of this study highlight the utility of population level molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VoC using wastewater. Wastewater monitoring for VoC can be a powerful tool in informing public health responses, including monitoring trends independent of clinical surveillance and providing early warning to communities.},

WS can assist public health decision-makers in the design and implementation of timely mitigation measures. There is an increased need to use reliable, cost-effective, simple, and rapid WS systems, given traditional analytical (or ‘gold-standard’) programs are instrument/time-intensive, and dependent on highly skilled personnel. This study investigated the application of the portable GeneXpert platform for WS of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The GeneXpert system with the Xpert Xpress-SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV test kit uses reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to analyze wastewater samples. From September 2022 through January 2023, wastewater samples were collected from the influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) of Saskatoon, Prince Albert, and North Battleford in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Both raw and concentrated wastewater samples were subjected to the GeneXpert analysis. Results showed that the Saskatoon wastewater viral loads were significantly correlated to Saskatchewan's influenza and COVID-19 clinical cases, with a lead time of 10~days for IAV and a lag time of 4~days for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the GeneXpert analysis of the three cities' wastewater samples showed that the raw WS could capture the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV due to their correlation with concentrated WS. Interestingly, IBV loads were not detected in any wastewater samples, while the Saskatoon and Prince Albert wastewater samples collected following the 2023 holiday season (end of December and beginning of January) were positive for RSV. This study indicates that the GeneXpert has excellent potential for use in the development of an early warning system for transmissible disease in municipalities and limited-resource communities while simultaneously providing stakeholders with an efficient WS methodology.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based surveillance has become an effective tool around the globe for indirect monitoring of COVID-19 in communities. Variants of Concern (VOCs) have been detected in wastewater by use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or whole genome sequencing (WGS). Rapid, reliable RT-PCR assays continue to be needed to determine the relative frequencies of VOCs and sub-lineages in wastewater-based surveillance programs. The presence of multiple mutations in a single region of the N-gene allowed for the design of a single amplicon, multiple probe assay, that can distinguish among several VOCs in wastewater RNA extracts. This approach which multiplexes probes designed to target mutations associated with specific VOC's along with an intra-amplicon universal probe (non-mutated region) was validated in singleplex and multiplex. The prevalence of each mutation (i.e. VOC) is estimated by comparing the abundance of the targeted mutation with a non-mutated and highly conserved region within the same amplicon. This is advantageous for the accurate and rapid estimation of variant frequencies in wastewater. The N200 assay was applied to monitor frequencies of VOCs in wastewater extracts from several communities in Ontario, Canada in near real time from November 28, 2021 to January 4, 2022. This includes the period of the rapid replacement of the Delta variant with the introduction of the Omicron variant in these Ontario communities in early December 2021. The frequency estimates using this assay were highly reflective of clinical WGS estimates for the same communities. This style of qPCR assay, which simultaneously measures signal from a non-mutated comparator probe and multiple mutation-specific probes contained within a single qPCR amplicon, can be applied to future assay development for rapid and accurate estimations of variant frequencies.},

However, approaches for its analysis by use of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are still far from standardized globally. To characterize inter- and intra-laboratory variability among results when using various methods deployed across Canada, aliquots from a real wastewater sample were spiked with surrogates of SARS-CoV-2 (gamma-radiation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus strain 229E [HCoV-229E]) at low and high levels then provided “blind” to eight laboratories. Concentration estimates reported by individual laboratories were consistently within a 1.0-log10 range for aliquots of the same spiked condition. All laboratories distinguished between low- and high-spikes for both surrogates. As expected, greater variability was observed in the results amongst laboratories than within individual laboratories, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration estimates for each spiked condition remained mostly within 1.0-log10 ranges. The no-spike wastewater aliquots provided yielded non-detects or trace levels ({$<$}20 gene copies/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detections appear linked to methods that included or focused on the solids fraction of the wastewater matrix and might represent in-situ SARS-CoV-2 to the wastewater sample. HCoV-229E RNA was not detected in the no-spike aliquots. Overall, all methods yielded comparable results at the conditions tested. Partitioning behavior of SARS-CoV-2 and spiked surrogates in wastewater should be considered to evaluate method effectiveness. A consistent method and laboratory to explore wastewater SARS-CoV-2 temporal trends for a given system, with appropriate quality control protocols and documented in adequate detail should succeed.,                         Image, graphical abstract},

  abstract = {Monitoring the communal incidence of COVID-19 is important for both government and residents of an area to make informed decisions. However, continuous reliance on one means of monitoring might not be accurate because of biases introduced by government policies or behaviours of residents. Wastewater surveillance was employed to monitor concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw influent wastewater from wastewater treatment plants serving three Canadian Prairie cities with different population sizes. Data obtained from wastewater are not directly influenced by government regulations or behaviours of individuals. The means of three weekly samples collected using 24 h composite auto-samplers were determined. Viral loads were determined by RT-qPCR, and whole-genome sequencing was used to charaterize variants of concern (VOC). The dominant VOCs in the three cities were the same but with different proportions of sub-lineages. Sub-lineages of Delta were AY.12, AY.25, AY.27 and AY.93 in 2021, while the major sub-lineage of Omicron was BA.1 in January 2022, and BA.2 subsequently became a trace-level sub-variant then the predominant VOC. When each VOC was first detected varied among cities; However, Saskatoon, with the largest population, was always the first to present new VOCs. Viral loads varied among cities, but there was no direct correlation with population size, possibly because of differences in flow regimes. Population is one of the factors that affects trends in onset and development of local outbreaks during the pandemic. This might be due to demography or the fact that larger populations had greater potential for inter- and intra-country migration. Hence, wastewater surveillance data from larger cities can typically be used to indicate what to expect in smaller communities.},

  abstract = {Wastewater based epidemiology is recognized as one of the monitoring pillars, providing essential information for pandemic management. Central in the methodology are data modelling concepts for both communicating the monitoring results but also for analysis of the signal. It is due to the fast development of the field that a range of modelling concepts are used but without a coherent framework. This paper provides for such a framework, focusing on robust and simple concepts readily applicable, rather than applying latest findings from e.g., machine learning. It is demonstrated that data preprocessing, most important normalization by means of biomarkers and equal temporal spacing of the scattered data, is crucial. In terms of the latter, downsampling to a weekly spaced series is sufficient. Also, data smoothing turned out to be essential, not only for communication of the signal dynamics but likewise for regressions, nowcasting and forecasting. Correlation of the signal with epidemic indicators requires multivariate regression as the signal alone cannot explain the dynamics but – for this case study – multiple linear regression proofed to be a suitable tool when the focus is on understanding and interpretation. It was also demonstrated that short term prediction (7 days) is accurate with simple models (exponential smoothing or autoregressive models) but forecast accuracy deteriorates fast for longer periods.},

An inherent challenge is substantial noise and bias in wastewater data because of the sampling and quantification process, limiting the applicability of wastewater surveillance as a monitoring tool. Aim To present an analytical framework for capturing the growth trend of circulating infections from wastewater data and conducting scenario analyses to guide policy decisions. Methods We developed a mathematical model for translating the observed SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater into effective reproduction numbers. We used an extended Kalman filter to infer underlying transmissions by smoothing out observational noise. We also illustrated the impact of different countermeasures such as expanded vaccinations and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the projected number of cases using three study areas in Japan during 2021–22 as an example. Results Observed notified cases were matched with the range of cases estimated by our approach with wastewater data only, across different study areas and virus quantification methods, especially when the disease prevalence was high. Estimated reproduction numbers derived from wastewater data were consistent with notification-based reproduction numbers. Our projections showed that a 10–20\% increase in vaccination coverage or a 10\% reduction in contact rate may suffice to initiate a declining trend in study areas. Conclusion Our study demonstrates how wastewater data can be used to track reproduction numbers and perform scenario modelling to inform policy decisions. The proposed framework complements conventional clinical surveillance, especially when reliable and timely epidemiological data are not available.},

  abstract = {Background: Day-to-day variation in the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can challenge public health interpretation. We assessed a Bayesian smoothing and forecasting method previously used for surveillance and short-term projection of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 viral measurement from the sewershed in Ottawa, Canada, sampled at the municipal wastewater treatment plant from July 1, 2020, to February 15, 2022, was used to assess and internally validate measurement averaging and prediction. External validation was performed using viral measurement data from influent wastewater samples from 15 wastewater treatment plants and municipalities across Ontario. Results: Plots of SARS-CoV-2 viral measurement over time using Bayesian smoothing visually represented distinct COVID-19 “waves” described by case and hospitalization data in both initial (Ottawa) and external validation in 15 Ontario communities. The time-varying growth rate of viral measurement in wastewater samples approximated the growth rate observed for cases and hospitalization. One-week predicted viral measurement approximated the observed viral measurement throughout the assessment period from December 23, 2020, to August 8, 2022. An uncalibrated model showed underprediction during rapid increases in viral measurement (positive growth) and overprediction during rapid decreases. After recalibration, the model showed a close approximation between observed and predicted estimates. Conclusion: Bayesian smoothing of wastewater surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 allows for accurate estimates of COVID-19 growth rates and one- and two-week forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater for 16 municipalities in Ontario, Canada. Further assessment is warranted in other communities representing different sewersheds and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Disease modelling has had considerable policy impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it is increasingly acknowledged that combining multiple models can improve the reliability of outputs. Here we report insights from ten weeks of collaborative short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland (12 October–19 December 2020). The study period covers the onset of the second wave in both countries, with tightening non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequently a decay (Poland) or plateau and renewed increase (Germany) in reported cases. Thirteen independent teams provided probabilistic real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These were reported for lead times of one to four weeks, with evaluation focused on one- and two-week horizons, which are less affected by changing NPIs. Heterogeneity between forecasts was considerable both in terms of point predictions and forecast spread. Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance, in particular in terms of coverage, but did not clearly dominate single-model predictions. The study was preregistered and will be followed up in future phases of the pandemic.},

This manuscript presents a dataset from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023, with RT-qPCR results for SARS-CoV-2 genes and PMMoV from 107 sites across all 34 public health units in Ontario, covering 72\% of the province’s and 26.2\% of Canada’s population. Sampling occurred 2–7 times weekly, including geographical coordinates, serviced populations, physico-chemical water characteristics, and flowrates. In doing so, this manuscript ensures data availability and metadata preservation to support future research and epidemic preparedness through detailed analyses and modeling. The dataset has been crucial for public health in tracking disease locally, especially with the rise of the Omicron variant and the decline in clinical testing, highlighting wastewater-based surveillance’s role in estimating disease incidence in Ontario.},

Detecting viral RNA load in wastewater samples has been suggested as an effective approach for epidemic monitoring and the development of an effective warning system. However, its quantitative link to the epidemic status and the stages of outbreak is still elusive. Modelling is thus crucial to address these challenges. In this study, we present a novel mechanistic model-based approach to reconstruct the complete epidemic dynamics from SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater. Our approach integrates noisy wastewater data and daily case numbers into a dynamical epidemiological model. As demonstrated for various regions and sampling protocols, it quantifies the case numbers, provides epidemic indicators and accurately infers future epidemic trends. Following its quantitative analysis, we also provide recommendations for wastewater data standards and for their use as warning indicators against new infection waves. In situations of reduced testing capacity, our modelling approach can enhance the surveillance of wastewater for early epidemic prediction and robust and cost-effective real-time monitoring of local COVID-19 dynamics.},

Using WBE datasets to train machine learning algorithms and develop predictive models may also facilitate early warnings for the spread of outbreaks. The challenges associated with using machine learning for the analysis of WBE datasets and timeseries forecasting of COVID-19 were explored by running Random Forest (RF) algorithms on WBE datasets across 108 sites in five regions: Scotland, Catalonia, Ohio, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. This method uses measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment concentration in samples taken at the inlets of wastewater treatment plants, providing insight into the prevalence of infection in upstream wastewater catchment populations. RF's forecasting performance at each site was quantitatively evaluated by determining mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values, which was used to highlight challenges affecting future implementations of RF for WBE forecasting efforts. Performance was generally poor using WBE datasets from Catalonia, Scotland, and Ohio with ‘reasonable’ or better forecasts constituting 0 \%, 5 \%, and 0 \% of these regions' forecasts, respectively. RF's performance was much stronger with WBE data from the Netherlands and Switzerland, which provided 55 \% and 45 \% ‘reasonable’ or better forecasts respectively. Sampling frequency and training set size were identified as key factors contributing to accuracy, while inclusion of too many unnecessary variables (or e.g., flow data) was identified as a contributing factor to poor performance. The contribution of catchment population on forecast accuracy was more ambiguous. This study determined that the factors governing RF's forecast performance are complicated and interrelated, which presents challenges for further work in this space. A sufficiently accurate further iteration of the tool discussed within this study would provide significant but varying value for public health departments for monitoring future, or ongoing outbreaks, assisting the implementation of on-time health response measures.},

The amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in wastewater are known to correlate with clinical data including cases and hospital admissions for COVID-19. We developed and tested a predictive model for incident COVID-19 hospital admissions in New York State using wastewater data. Methods Using county-level COVID-19 hospital admissions and wastewater surveillance covering 13.8 million people across 56 counties, we fit a generalized linear mixed model predicting new hospital admissions from wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from April 29, 2020 to June 30, 2022. We included covariates such as COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the county, comorbidities, demographic variables, and holiday gatherings. Findings Wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlated with new hospital admissions per 100,000 up to ten days prior to admission. Models that included wastewater had higher predictive power than models that included clinical cases only, increasing the accuracy of the model by 15\%. Predicted hospital admissions correlated highly with observed admissions (r~=~0.77) with an average difference of 0.013 hospitalizations per 100,000 (95\% CI~=~[0.002, 0.025]) Interpretation Using wastewater to predict future hospital admissions from COVID-19 is accurate and effective with superior results to using case data alone. The lead time of ten days could alert the public to take precautions and improve resource allocation for seasonal surges.},

The new approach consists of a method for simplifying a complex sewer network into a simpler, yet accurate, computationally efficient (conceptual) model able to capture the relevant sewer dynamics, both in terms of water quantity and water quality entering the wastewater treatment plant. Water quality predicted by the conceptual model was assessed using a detailed biochemical process model and compared against a whole-network biochemical model that covers all hydraulic segments and pipes of the sewer system. The conceptual biochemical model achieves very similar results as the whole-network model in terms of water quality, while providing much faster simulation speed (minutes rather than hours) and easy calibration. Given these advantages, the conceptual biochemical model of a collection system can be used in an integrated model with which sewer and WWTP can be simulated simultaneously for long-term evaluation of optimization scenarios. The model was applied to the prediction of the biochemical components, e.g. sulfide, organics and nutrients, which are essential for the control and management of sewer corrosion and pollutant removal.},

Their behaviour in sewer systems has thus been object of many studies, but, unfortunately the predictive power of the available models remains limited due to the complexity of the processes that determine their transport, sampling and measurement. This contribution summarizes 10 years of research at Université Laval that took advantage of the ViCAs measurement set-up that allows for characterizing the wastewater particles’ settling velocity distribution (PSVD) to come up with a conceptual modelling framework of storm and wastewater transport systems in which mass balances are made of particle classes, each with a characteristic settling velocity. The models have been calibrated and validated for stormwater basins, combined sewer retention tanks, primary clarifiers and complete combined sewer systems, from sewer catchment to stormwater basins outlets, sewer overflows and primary clarifier effluents. The ViCAs experimental set-up is simple to build and work with, and has intrinsic quality control indicators that allow evaluating the quality of the obtained PSVD’s.},

To this end, a modelling study was conducted with an integrated model inspired by a real case study for which extensive measurement campaigns were conducted at the level of the retention tanks and the primary settler of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The integrated model, developed in the WEST® software, describes three catchments, each equipped with a retention tank, linked to a combined sewer system that transports the wastewater to the WWTP that is modelled in terms of its grit chamber and primary settling tank, with possibility for chemical enhancement by alum addition. All of the unit process models describe the dynamics of the suspended solids concentration using an approach based on particle settling velocity distributions. Nine wet weather emptying scenarios were tested. For each scenario, the characteristics of the retention tank emptying procedure and the alum addition were modified. The results show the significant reduction in mass of suspended solids discharged to the receiving water. This came at the expense of an acceptable increase in emptying times. For the case study the suspended solids emissions were reduced by 26\% and 43\% for an increase in emptying time of 65\% and 110\% respectively. The addition of alum allowed improving the primary treatment efficiency, leading not only to a further decrease in suspended solids emission, but also suggesting to allow more water to be sent to the WWTP.},

  abstract = {How can intelligent agents solve a diverse set of tasks in a data-efficient manner? The disentangled representation learning approach posits that such an agent would benefit from separating out (disentangling) the underlying structure of the world into disjoint parts of its representation. However, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of disentangling, not least because it is unclear how to formalise the notion of world structure beyond toy datasets with a known ground truth generative process. Here we propose that a principled solution to characterising disentangled representations can be found by focusing on the transformation properties of the world. In particular, we suggest that those transformations that change only some properties of the underlying world state, while leaving all other properties invariant, are what gives exploitable structure to any kind of data. Similar ideas have already been successfully applied in physics, where the study of symmetry transformations has revolutionised the understanding of the world structure. By connecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the formalism of group and representation theory we arrive at the first formal definition of disentangled representations. Our new definition is in agreement with many of the current intuitions about disentangling, while also providing principled resolutions to a number of previous points of contention. While this work focuses on formally defining disentangling - as opposed to solving the learning problem - we believe that the shift in perspective to studying data transformations can stimulate the development of better representation learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from    imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.},

A total of 164 samples were collected weekly between February 19th and June 8th, 2021. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 47.2\% (52/110) influent samples and 37\% (20/54) effluent samples. The increasing percentage of positive influent samples correlated with the city’s increasing active clinical cases during the second wave of COVID-19 in Jaipur.

  abstract = {Treating municipal wastewater is a complex and costly process. With rising energy costs and sustainability targets, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are looking for alternatives to reduce operating costs and carbon dependence. Anaerobic digestion is the most common and established technology used in WWTPs to treat sludge since it can potentially improve energy recovery and reduce sewage treatment costs, mainly due to the generation of biogas. Biogas is a renewable energy resource and can be used in several applications, including heating and producing electricity. By exploring the biogas potential, WWTPs can reduce their operating costs and energy demands. The objective of this paper is to conduct a scoping literature review in order to provide the key concepts underpinning alternatives to improve biogas production and utilisation in WWTPs. In addition, this study aims to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art that may serve as a quick reference for the research community, WWTP operators, and engineers, including definitions and a general overview of the current state of biogas technologies around the world. Methods to increase biogas production, including co-digestion, pre-treatment, and biological hydrogen methanation, are reviewed, and the alternatives to using biogas are also summarised. This review has identified that co-digestion was the most efficient technique to improve biogas production and methane yield, while pre-treatment of sludge improved sludge biodegradability and reduced sludge treatment costs but also enhanced biogas production. Although many studies have explored different methods to improve biogas production in WWTPs, there is still a need for further investigation, especially regarding the techno-economic feasibility of these methods in full-scale facilities. The current challenges are mainly related to the need for extra investment and increased operating costs to integrate the new techniques into the current system. There is a great interest in alternatives to improve energy efficiency and self-sufficiency in WWTPs. This work provides an important review of the increasing number of recently published research papers that focus on improving biogas generation from sewage sludge in WWTPs.},

To respond to this knowledge gap, this article documents the framework of a successful WBE program in Arizona, titled Wastewater Analysis for Tactical Epidemiological Response Systems (WATERS), detailing the developed structure and methods of communication that enabled public health preparedness and response actions.

  abstract = {Objectives: We systematically reviewed studies using wastewater for AMR surveillance in human populations, to determine: (i) evidence of concordance between wastewater-human AMR prevalence estimates, and (ii) meth­ odological approaches which optimised identifying such an association, and which could be recommended as standard. We used Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) to quantify concordance between AMR prevalence estimates in wastewater and human compartments (where CCC = 1 reflects perfect concordance), and logistic regression to identify study features (e.g. sampling methods) associated with high agreement studies (defined as {$>$}70\% of within-study wastewater-human AMR prevalence comparisons within ±10\%). Results: Of 8,867 records and 441 full-text methods reviewed, 33 studies were included. AMR prevalence data was extractable from 24 studies conducting phenotypic-only (n = 7), genotypic-only (n = 1) or combined (n = 16) AMR detection. Overall concordance of wastewater-human AMR prevalence estimates was reasonably high for both phenotypic (CCC = 0.85 [95\% CI 0.8–0.89]) and genotypic approaches (CCC = 0.88 (95\% CI 0.84–0.9)) despite diverse study designs, bacterial species investigated and phenotypic/genotypic targets. No significant relationships between methodological approaches and high agreement studies were identified using logistic regression; however, this was limited by inconsistent reporting of study features, significant heterogeneity in approaches and limited sample size. Based on a secondary, descriptive synthesis, studies conducting composite sampling of wastewater influent, longitudinal sampling {$>$}12 months, and time-/location-matched sampling of wastewater and human compartments generally had higher agreement. Conclusion: Wastewater-based surveillance of AMR appears promising, with high overall concordance between wastewater and human AMR prevalence estimates in studies irrespective of heterogenous approaches. However, our review suggests future work would benefit from: time-/location-matched sampling of wastewater and human populations, composite sampling of influent, and sampling {$>$}12 months for longitudinal studies. Further research and clear and consistent reporting of study methods is required to identify optimal practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Continually improving and affordable wastewater management provides opportunities for both pollution reduction and clean water supply augmentation, while simultaneously promoting sustainable development and supporting the transition to a circular economy. This study aims to provide the first comprehensive and consistent global outlook on the state of domestic and manufacturing wastewater production, collection, treatment and reuse. We use a data-driven approach, collating, cross-examining and standardising country-level wastewater data from online data resources. Where unavailable, data are estimated using multiple linear regression. Country-level wastewater data are subsequently downscaled and validated at 5\,arcmin (∼10\,km) resolution. This study estimates global wastewater production at 359.4×109\,m3\,yr−1, of which 63\,\% (225.6×109\,m3\,yr−1) is collected and 52\,\% (188.1×109\,m3\,yr−1) is treated. By extension, we estimate that 48\,\% of global wastewater production is released to the environment untreated, which is substantially lower than previous estimates of ∼80\,\%. An estimated 40.7×109\,m3\,yr−1 of treated wastewater is intentionally reused. Substantial differences in per capita wastewater production, collection and treatment are observed across different geographic regions and by level of economic development. For example, just over 16\,\% of the global population in high-income countries produces 41\,\% of global wastewater. Treated-wastewater reuse is particularly substantial in the Middle East and North Africa (15\,\%) and western Europe (16\,\%), while comprising just 5.8\,\% and 5.7\,\% of the global population, respectively. Our database serves as a reference for understanding the global wastewater status and for identifying hotspots where untreated wastewater is released to the environment, which are found particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Importantly, our results also serve as a baseline for evaluating progress towards many policy goals that are both directly and indirectly connected to wastewater management. Our spatially explicit results available at 5\,arcmin resolution are well suited for supporting more detailed hydrological analyses such as water quality modelling and large-scale water resource assessments and can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.918731 (Jones et al., 2020).},

Our industry is quickly moving from an end-of-pipe environmental protection service to an economic producer of valued products for society. Based on a critical review of resource recovery technologies that are currently applied or in advanced development, it became obvious that most of these technologies are based on physicochemical unit processes (precipitation, volatilization, sorption, …). Current industrial practice for the design and operation of WRRFs is based on mathematical models describing the traditional biological processes. The modeling challenge therefore is to provide practice with proper models for the physicochemical resource recovery processes. The fact that the WRRFs aim at delivering valued products that can partially replace those produced by other means (typically in the chemical industry) leads to a paradigm shift in specifications of the outputs of the facility: no longer treated wastewater and biosolids, but products that have to compete with what is already on the market. The tighter specifications will thus impose a challenge on the process control systems that will be required to guarantee the quality of the products of the WRRFs.},

As more sublineages were discovered, it increased the difficulty in identifying distinct variants in a mixed population sample, particularly those without a known lineage. Here, we compare two next-generation sequencing technologies, Illumina and Nanopore, in order to determine their efficacy at detecting variants of differing abundance, using 248 wastewater samples from various Quebec and Ontario cities. Our study used two analytical approaches to identify main variants in the samples: the presence of signature and marker mutations, and the co-occurrence of signature mutations within the same amplicon. We observed that each sequencing method detected certain variants at different frequencies as each method preferentially detects mutations of distinct variants. Illumina sequencing detected more mutations with a predominant lineage that is in low abundance across the population or unknown for that time period, while Nanopore sequencing had a higher detection rate of mutations that are predominantly found in the high abundance B.1.1.7 (Alpha) lineage as well as a higher sequencing rate of co-occurring mutations in the same amplicon. We present a workflow that integrates short read and long read sequencing to improve the detection of SARSCoV-2 variant lineages in mixed population samples, such as wastewater.},

  abstract = {Surveillance networks have been established in many countries worldwide to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and to estimate the communal prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Despite their popularity, gaining a rapid understanding of how infectious diseases spread across the territory covered by a network is difficult because of the many factors involved. To improve the detection of warning signals within the territory, we propose to apply principal component analysis (PCA) to screen time-series data generated from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) under surveillance. Our analysis allows us to identify single WWTPs deviating from the normal behavior as well as deviations of a cluster of WWTPs (indicative of an intermunicipal outbreak). Our approach is illustrated through the analysis of the dataset generated by the Catalan Surveillance Network of SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage (SARSAIGUA). Using 10 principal components, we captured 78.6\% of the variance in the original dataset of 51 variables (WWTPs). Our analysis identified exceedance of the Q-statistic threshold as evidence of anomalous performance of a single WWTP, and exceedance of the T2-statistic as a sign of an intermunicipal outbreak. Our approach provides a comprehensive picture of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling decision-makers to make informed decisions and better manage future pandemics.},

The forecast model incorporates the vaccination process, the confinement, and the detection rate, and virtually allows to consider any nonpharmaceutical intervention, enabling to understand their effects on the disease's containment while forecasting the trend of the pandemic. A continuous validation process of the model is performed using real data and an optimization model that automatically provides information regarding the effects of the containment actions on the population. To simplify this validation process, a formal graphical language that simplifies the interaction with the different specialists and an easy modification of the model parameters are used. The Digital Twin of the pandemic in Catalonia provides a forecast of the future trend of the SARS-CoV-2 spread and information regarding the true cases and effectiveness of the NPIs to control the SARS-CoV-2 spread over the population. This approach can be applied easily to other regions and can become an excellent tool for decision-making.},

To address this limitation, this study expands the database 12-fold and develops a tier-based approach. Our method considers emission variations across spatial scales, treatment processes and monitoring techniques, enabling more-precise estimations. Here, applying this approach to the US database, we highlight the limitations of current estimations based on uniform EFs and quantified the mean wastewater N2O emission in the United States to be 11.6\,MMT\,CO2-eq. The results also reveal the diverse nature of wastewater N2O emissions and underscore the need for a customized approach to inform facility-level N2O emission estimation as well as inform national- and sector-wide greenhouse gases inventories with emphasis on site-specific considerations. Overall, this study provides a tool to recalibrate the estimations of wastewater N2O emissions, which form the foundation of carbon footprint reduction in wastewater treatment.},

Israel and the Palestinian Authority are located in a geographical region in which poliovirus is still endemic but have been free of poliomyelitis since 1988 as a result of intensive immunization programs and mass vaccination campaigns. To monitor the wild-type virus circulation, environmental surveillance of sewage samples collected monthly from 25 to 30 sites across the country was implemented in 1989 and AFP surveillance began in 1994. The sewage samples were processed in the laboratory with a double-selective tissue culture system, which enabled economical processing of large number of samples. Between 1989 and 1997, 2,294 samples were processed, and wild-type poliovirus was isolated from 17 of them in four clusters, termed “silent outbreaks,” in September 1990 (type 3), between May and September 1991 (type 1), between October 1994 and June 1995 (type 1), and in December 1996 (type 1). Fifteen of the 17 positive samples were collected in the Gaza Strip, 1 was collected in the West Bank, and 1 was collected in the Israeli city of Ashdod, located close to the Gaza Strip. The AFP surveillance system failed to detect the circulating wild-type viruses. These findings further emphasize the important role that environmental surveillance can play in monitoring the eradication of polioviruses.},

Advantage was taken of a 3-stage mass poliovaccine campaign in the area to test this. During the 35 weeks of the investigation Moore's swabs were suspended at 6 sites for 48 hours. The 222 samples collected were ultracentrifuged and inoculated into monkey kidney cells, the latter also being inoculated with stool specimens from clinically ill members of the population. During the last 18 weeks suckling mice were also inoculated. 6 sampling sites were monitored; 3 sites overlapped so that site 2 included site 1, and site 3 included both 1 and 2. Sites 4 and 5 represented separate blocks and site 6 represented the final pathway of sites 1-5 as well as buildings not included in other sites.  After the administration of type 1 vaccine this type appeared exclusively at all sites for 40 days in 95\% of 38 samples. Type 1 was virtually replaced by type 3 which was administered 6 weeks after type 1, being recovered from 88\% of samples over the next 6 weeks from all sites. A different pattern occurred after the administration of type 2 vaccine 6 weeks later. Polio virus 2 was recovered from 46 of 47 samples, 26 of which also contained polio-virus 3. From 4 to 7 weeks after administration of type 2, all 3 types were isolated from the final collection point at site 6.  The changing pattern of virus excretion is said to reflect the known pattern of poliovaccine multiplication in the intestine. Only 3 isolations of 'wild' enterovkus were made before vaccination began and the success of the campaign was attributed to the absence of interfering 'wild' virus at the beginning. Until 14 weeks after the last vaccine administration only one entero virus other than polio-virus was isolated from 212 stool specimens collected during this period.  An outbreak due to a Coxsackie B5 virus now occurred. This was detected in sewage isolates before clinical illness was recognized and before stool isolates from clinical infections were positive. B5 virus was obtained only from sampling points serving residents whose stools contained this virus, none being recovered from sampling sites serving buildings whose sampled populations had negative stools.  The use of multiple sampling sites at strategic points in the sewage collection system was shown to be a useful method for the early detection and localization of infections associated with the enteroviruses.

A prospective multicenter cohort study of COVID-19 adult patients, with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs admitted to four hospitals in Spain, from March 2020 to February 2021. Sixty-two adult COVID-19 patients had stool samples collected at admission and/or during the follow up, with a total of 79 stool samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples from 27 (43.5\%) out of the 62 patients. Replicative virus, measured by the generation of cytopathic effect in cell culture and subsequent RT-PCR confirmation of a decrease in the Ct values, was not found in any of these stool samples. Fecal virus excretion was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, or with differences in the evolution of COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replicative capacity is null or very limited in stool samples, and thus, the fecal–oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative infection route is highly unlikely. In our study, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces at the beginning of the disease is not associated with any clinical factor nor with an unfavorable clinical outcome.},

Four real-world case studies, encompassing an aerated lagoon, a biofilm-enhanced aerated lagoon, a stormwater basin, and a constructed wetland were reviewed to demonstrate practical applications and challenges in modelling NBS systems. The initial proposed modelling framework was derived from these case studies and encompassed eight sub-models used for these NBS types. The framework was subsequently extended to include eight additional NBS categories, requiring a total of 10 sub-models. In a subsequent step, with a different perspective, the framework was refined to focus on 13 primary use cases of NBS, identifying 10 sub-models needed or potentially required for these specific NBS applications. These frameworks help to identify the necessary sub-models for the NBS system at hand or the use case. This article also discusses the benefits and challenges of applying water resource recovery modelling best practices to NBS, along with recommendations for future research in this area.},

Our methodology was composed of interconnected age-stratified system dynamics models in an agent-based modeling framework that allowed for a granular examination of the scale and severity of disease spread, including metrics such as infection cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU usage. Model parameters were calibrated using an optimization technique with an objective function to minimize error associated with the cumulative cases of COVID-19 during a training period between March 15 and October 31, 2020. We outlined several case studies to demonstrate the model’s state- and local-level projection capabilities. We further demonstrated how model outcomes could be used to evaluate perceived levels of COVID-19 risk across different localities using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework. The model’s two, three, and four week out-of-sample projection errors varied on a state-by-state basis, and generally increased as the out-of-sample projection period was extended. Additionally, the prediction error in the state-level projections was generally due to an underestimation of cases and an overestimation of deaths. The proposed modeling approach can be used as a virtual laboratory to investigate a wide range of what-if scenarios and easily adapted to future high-consequence public health threats.},

In this study, an updated lumped pathway metabolic model (Phototrophic-Mixotrophic Process Model, PM2), including both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms of microalgae, was developed to predict effluent phosphorus concentration and biomass yield in response to dynamic influent and varying environmental conditions. The model was implemented in QSDsan – an open-source, Python-based design and simulation platform – for robust simulation under uncertainty. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to prioritize model parameters for calibration. The model was then calibrated and validated using batch experimental data and 45 days of continuous online monitoring data from a full-scale (568 m3·d-1) microalgae-based tertiary wastewater treatment plant (EcoRecover process). In particular, along with dynamic influent composition, temperature and light intensity data with diel variation were provided as model inputs to reflect the microalgal behavior under day-night cycling. Overall, the QSDsan-based microalgae process simulator was able to predict effluent phosphorus within 0.02–0.04 mg-P·L-1, while also capturing the general trends of state variables according to nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {The visual information on a scatterplot can be greatly enhanced, with little additional cost, by computing and plotting smoothed points. Robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (x i , y i ), i = 1, …, n, in which the fitted value at z k is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (x i , y i ) is large if x i is close to x k and small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. Several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications has led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains. AI is making its way into industry, beyond research and academia. Concurrently, the water sector is undergoing a digital transformation. Water utilities in the United States are at different stages in their journey of digital transformation, and the decision makers in water sector, who are non-expert stakeholders in AI applications, need to better understand this technology to make informed decisions. While AI has numerous benefits to offer, there are also many challenges related to data, model development, knowledge integration and ethical concerns that should be considered before implementing it for real world applications. Civil engineering is a licensed profession where critical decision making is involved. Therefore, trust in any decision support technology is critical for its acceptance in real-world applications. Therefore, this research proposes a framework called aiWATERS (Artificial Intelligence for the Water Sector) which can serve as a guide for the water utilities to successfully implement AI in their system. Based on this framework, we conduct pilot interviews and surveys with various small, medium, and large water utilities in the United States (US) to capture their current state of AI implementation and identify the challenges faced by them. The research findings reveal that most of the water utilities in the United States are at an early stage of implementing AI as they face concerns regarding the black box nature, trustworthiness, and sustainability of AI technology in their system. The aiWATERS framework is intended to help the utilities navigate through these issues in their journey of digital transformation.},

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and clinical surveillance have been used as tools for analyzing the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, but both approaches can be strongly influenced by some sources of variability. From the challenging perspective of integrating environmental and clinical data, we performed a correlation analysis between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in raw sewage and incident COVID-19 cases in areas served by medium-size wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from 2021 to 2023. To this aim, both datasets were adjusted for several sources of variability: WBE data were adjusted for factors including the analytical protocol, sewage flow, and population size, while clinical data adjustments considered the demographic composition of the served population. Then, we addressed the impact on the correlation of differences among sewerage networks and variations in the frequency and type of swab tests due to changes in political and regulatory scenarios. Wastewater and clinical data were significantly correlated when restrictive containment measures and limited movements were in effect (ρ\,=\,0.50) and when COVID-19 cases were confirmed exclusively through molecular testing (ρ\,=\,0.49). Moreover, a positive (although weak) correlation arose for WWTPs located in densely populated areas (ρ\,=\,0.37) and with shorter sewerage lengths (ρ\,=\,0.28). This study provides methodological approaches for interpreting WBE and clinical surveillance data, which could also be useful for other infections. Data adjustments and evaluation of possible sources of bias need to be carefully considered from the perspective of integrated environmental and clinical surveillance of infections.},

However, there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the fundamental role of AI in the development of urban water infrastructure (UWI). This review aimed to provide an analysis of how AI could be aligned to support the future development of UWI systems. Four types of AI analytics – descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive – are discussed and linked to the improvement in the performance of UWI systems from three categories: reliability, resilience and sustainability. It is envisioned that AI technology will play a pivotal role in UWI transitioning to the future through underpinning the five development pathways: decentralisation, circular economy, greening, decarbonisation and automation. The barriers in improving AI adoption in the real world are also highlighted from four dimensions: cyber-physical infrastructure, institutional governance, social-economic systems and technological development in wider society. Embedding AI in the development pathways and tackling the barriers can ensure that AI-empowered systems are deployed in an equitable and responsible way to improve the resilience and sustainability of future UWI systems.},

The annual and seasonal linear trends of rainfall, temperature, runoff, water level and evaporation were analysed for stations in downstream Kaduna River Basin during 1975-2014. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen’s estimator of slope procedures were adopted to identify if there exists an increasing or decreasing trend with their statistical significance at 95\% level of confidence. The datasets were checked to account for auto-correlation prior to determining trends using Mann-Kendall test. The existence of abrupt changes was detected by means of Cumulative Sum Charts and Bootstrapping analysis. The results of study indicated increasing trends for seasonal and annual temperature and runoff series. Water level and evaporation revealed statistically decreasing trends both on annual and seasonal periods. However, for the period 1975 to 2014 no significant distinctive trend was observed for rainfall at the investigated stations. Change-points in time series were identified in all the investigated hydro-climatic records for the sub-basin. Generally, the detection of the trend for hydro-climatic variables by Mann-Kendall test conforms to Sen’s test results. It is concluded that the basin is sensitive to climate variability and water stress impacts which will affect food security. So, it would be necessary to make adjustments in the adaptive water-use strategies being adopted at present in the catchment.},
