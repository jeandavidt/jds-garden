I'm JD, and this is a little corner of the internet I'm carving out into a [[digital garden]].
That means anything written here isn't intended to be definitive. Like real gardens, this one is a work-always-in-progress. It uses hyperlinks to create (unforeseen) paths between ideas.

It exists because I need a place to think that is less cramped than just the inside of my skull, but not as shouty as a social media handle.

Existing on the internet (and the world, really) means you constantly come across events, ideas and content that deserve more than a cursory glance and a scroll. Hopefully, this garden can allow me to hold space for some of those things.
