## Nice of you to drop by!

I'm Jean-David, and this is my corner of the Internet.

## About me

At work, I'm a [PhD researcher](https://www.zotero.org/jeandavidtherrien) interested in the intersection between wastewater treatment, metadata creation and curation, ontologies, and artificial intelligence. My research asks, "how best can we manipulate the massive amounts of data we collect into becoming actionable insights about our process?"

While,  uh, *not-at-work*, I like photography, movies, running, coding, and learning stuff.

This site serves as my [[digital garden]]
