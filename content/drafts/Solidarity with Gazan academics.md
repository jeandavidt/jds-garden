The administrators of the Gaza Strip's three public universities have released an open letter calling for solidarity from the worldwide academic community. 

"Despite the physical obliteration of campuses, laboratories, libraries, and other facilities, and the assassination of our students and colleagues, our universities continue to exist. We are more than buildings — we are academic communities, comprised of students, faculty, and staff, still alive and determined to carry forward our mission". 

Every single higher education institution in Gaza has been targeted by Israel's onslaught. None were spared from devastation. 

As members of the academic community, we cannot stay silent when the absolute right of a population to educate itself, build a brighter future, and share their knowledge with the rest of the world is violated. We cannot tolerate our colleagues not enjoying the same level of safety and protection from physical harm as we do in other parts of the world.

I stand with the 625,000 children who are being robbed of their human right to education by forced displacement, mass starvation and mass destruction of schools, libraries and universities. I mourn with them the loss of over 10,000 of their pupils and over 500 teachers. I join my voice with theirs in denouncing this scholasticide – just one of the bitter spikes in the ongoing genocide's crown of thorns.
